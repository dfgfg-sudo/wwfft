## Quick start

### Requirements

1. **Ollama** running, with at least one **tool-capable** model installed.
2. **Python 3.12+** (a virtualenv is created for you by `launch.sh`).
3. Optional: **Docker** for SearXNG (private web search, see [setup](#setting-up-searxng-optional-for-web-search)) and for the sandbox.

```bash
# A tool-capable model, plus the embedding model used by local RAG:
ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama pull bge-m3
```

### Launching the agent

**From inside a project folder (the main use):**
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-project
bash /path/to/Ollamancer/launch.sh
```

**Passing the folder as an argument:**
```bash
bash /path/to/Ollamancer/launch.sh ~/projects/my-project
```

**Starting directly in safe mode:**
```bash
bash /path/to/Ollamancer/launch.sh ~/projects/my-project --safe
# or, mid-session: /safe
```

**Without a specific project (current folder):**
```bash
cd /path/to/Ollamancer
bash launch.sh
# or directly:
.venv/bin/python agent.py
```

`launch.sh` creates the Python environment if it is missing and installs the dependencies.

**Launch flags:** `--safe` (approve risky tool calls), `--sandbox` (Docker isolation),
`--private` (ephemeral, unlogged session; alias `--incognito`).

### Checking prerequisites

```bash
ollama list          # models installed
ollama serve         # start Ollama if it isn't running
curl "http://localhost:8080/search?q=test&format=json"   # is SearXNG up?
```

### Setting up SearXNG (optional, for web search)

Skip this if you do not need web search. Without SearXNG, `search_web` falls back to the
`duckduckgo` MCP server if you have it configured, and otherwise reports itself
unavailable; everything else in the agent works normally.

SearXNG is a self-hosted metasearch engine. It queries public engines on your behalf and
returns the results, so no search account or API key is involved. The quickest way to get
one is Docker:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/searxng
docker run -d --name searxng -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/searxng:/etc/searxng \
  -e "BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/" \
  searxng/searxng
```

**Then do the one step that is easy to miss.** A stock SearXNG serves HTML only, and this
agent asks for `format=json`. Until JSON is enabled every search fails. Edit
`~/searxng/settings.yml`, which the container writes on first start, and make sure the
formats list includes `json`:

```yaml
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

Then restart it and confirm you get JSON rather than a page of HTML:

```bash
docker restart searxng
curl "http://localhost:8080/search?q=test&format=json"
```

If that returns JSON, the agent needs no configuration: it looks at
`http://localhost:8080/search` by default. If you run SearXNG on another host or port, set
**Search: SearXNG URL** in `/parameters`, which persists across sessions.

Two settings worth knowing once it works. **Search Results Kept** controls how many
results `search_web` retains, and **Deep Search: Pages Fetched** how many of them
`search_web_deep` actually opens and reads. Raising the second is what buys source
diversity on a research question, at the cost of a slower turn.

## The startup interface

```
────────────────────────────   Ollamancer   ────────────────────────────
  Project : /Users/you/projects/my-project      ← the project root
  Model   : gemma4:12b-mlx
  Tools   : search_web, fetch_url, read_file, write_file, edit_file,
            create_directory, list_directory, run_command, get_datetime
  Help    : type /help
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You →
```

Type your message after `You →` and press Enter.

---

## Slash commands

> Note: **Autocomplete.** Type **`/`** and a dropdown lists **every** command with its
> description; each extra character **filters** the list (e.g. `/c` → `/clear`, `/context`,
> `/compact`; `/co` → `/context`, `/compact`). Navigate with ↑/↓, accept with Tab or Enter.
> Descriptions follow the interface language (`/lang`). Requires `prompt_toolkit`; falls back
> silently to plain input if it is absent.

> **Stopping the model.** Press **Esc** (or **Ctrl+C**) while the model is working to
> **stop it and return to the prompt** without leaving the session. It works during streaming
> (on by default); the stream to Ollama is genuinely cut. The partial conversation stays in
> context, type a new request, or `/clear` to start over. Esc detection only activates in an
> interactive terminal. It has no effect in headless mode.

>  **Quitting.** At the prompt, **Ctrl+C cancels the current line and does NOT quit**
> (consistent with "Ctrl+C = stop" during generation, and it avoids accidental exits). To
> quit, use **`/exit`** or **Ctrl+D**.

## Headless mode

```bash
# A single prompt: exit code 0 on success, 1 otherwise (ideal for cron/scripts)
.venv/bin/python agent.py --run "summarise the README and write a CHANGELOG" ~/my/project

# A markdown recipe (## Constraints and ## Steps sections, or a plain list)
.venv/bin/python agent.py --recipe tasks.md ~/my/project
```

Only the final answer(s) go to stdout; progress goes to stderr.

---

## What the agent can do

The agent has **35 tools** it uses **automatically**. You never need to name a tool, the
model decides on its own. For the exhaustive list, see [`capabilities.md`](./capabilities.md).

### Highlighted tools

**`append_file(path, content)`**: write a long file in reliable chunks. The system prompt
guides the model: beyond ~80 lines, write the first chunk with `write_file` and continue with
`append_file` (each small call avoids Ollama's JSON-truncation bug on large arguments).
```
You → create a 300-line utils.py module with these functions: ...
  → the model writes the file in ≤80-line blocks (write_file, then append_file ×N)
```

**`repo_map(focus, max_chars)`**: an outline of the whole project, every file's classes
and functions with no bodies, ranked so the widely used modules come first. Use it before
reading or grepping on an unfamiliar codebase. Ranking is PageRank over a graph whose
edges mean "this file uses a name that file defines", so a module twenty others depend on
outranks a leaf script. Python is read with the standard library and needs nothing
installed; other languages need the `treesitter` extra and are otherwise listed without
their definitions rather than dropped.
```
You → what is this project?
  → repo_map returns a ranked outline, then you read only what matters
You → repo_map(focus="retry") to rank the retry machinery first
```

**`search_semantic(query)`**: conceptual search across the project (local RAG). Embeddings
via `bge-m3`, SQLite index in `.agentic/`, re-indexed automatically when files change.
Complements `search_in_files` (exact) and `find_references` (symbols).
```
You → where is the retry logic for plumbing bugs handled?
  → search_semantic returns the closest chunks by meaning, with file:line
```

**`analyze_image(path, question)`**: understand an image.
```
You → take a screenshot and tell me why the button is misaligned
  → run_command("screencapture /tmp/s.png") then analyze_image("/tmp/s.png", "...")
```
Configure the model with `/vision-model` (otherwise an installed multimodal model is
auto-detected). Loading is sequential: the main model is unloaded for the duration of the
vision call, then reloaded.

**`python_repl(code)`**: persistent Python interpreter (state survives between calls).
```
You → load data.csv, show the columns then the mean of the price column
  → python_repl("import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('data.csv'); df.columns")
  → python_repl("df['price'].mean()")   # df is still there
```
Same safety as `run_command`: dangerous-command filter, Docker sandbox under `/sandbox`,
approval under `/safe`.

###  Self-correction

If the model modifies a file and ends its reply **without** calling `lint_file` or
`run_tests` afterwards, the agent automatically re-prompts it (up to twice per turn) with a
message pushing it to verify. You will see ` Auto-check:...` when this fires. That is
normal, not an error.

Since v2.9.19 the reminder no longer presents `lint_file` as sufficient proof: it pushes the
model to actually run the script (`run_command`) for any non-trivial logic, and `run_command`
now counts as real verification alongside `lint_file`/`run_tests`.

### yes Task checklist (`todo_write` / `todo_read`)

For any task with more than 3 steps, the model is instructed to create a markdown checklist
(`todo_write`) before starting, then keep it updated (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`) rather than
re-deciding the plan every turn. It is plain in-memory text for the session, no imposed
format. `/todo` shows the current checklist. Empty at startup and after `/clear`.

###  Background processes

`run_command` has a 30s timeout, useless for starting a dev server or a watcher that never
terminates. `run_background` starts the command without blocking and returns an id; the model
polls its output with `check_process(id)` and stops it with `kill_process(id)`. Limit: 5
simultaneous processes per session.

```
You → start npm run dev in the background, check it responds on port 3000, then stop it
```

**Safety/hygiene:**
- Every command goes through the same safety filter as `run_command` (blocks `rm -rf`, fork bombs, etc.).
- Output (stdout+stderr) is redirected to `.agentic/bg_logs/bg_<id>.log`.
- **Every process still alive at the end of the session is stopped automatically** (`/exit`, Ctrl+C, or crash), no orphan server left running after you close the agent.
- `/ps` and `/kill <id>` give you direct control, without depending on the model.

###  Persistent memory (`memory_write` / `memory_read`)

Difference from `/todo`: the task checklist is **lost** at the end of the session (or on
`/clear`). That is intended: it only concerns the current task. Memory is designed to
**survive**: written to `.agentic/memory.md` and reloaded automatically into the system prompt
every time the agent starts.

**When it is written (important):**
- **Only when the model calls the `memory_write` tool**: in practice, when **you ask it to
  remember something** ("remember that…", "keep this convention in mind"), or when it judges
  on its own that a durable fact is worth keeping. Nothing else writes it.
- **No automatic saving:** nothing is written on exit, nor each turn, nor when the agent edits
  files. The current conversation never goes there by itself.
- **Writing = full replacement:** every `memory_write` **overwrites** the previous content
  entirely (it is not an append). To modify or remove an item, ask the model to update the
  memory, it rewrites the whole text without that item.
- In a **`--private`** session, `memory_write` is a **no-op** (nothing is written to disk).

```
You → Remember that I prefer commit messages in English, under 50 characters
```
Then, in a **brand-new session** (agent restarted):
```
You → How do I want my commits again?
→ the agent answers correctly without you having to repeat it
```

**Caveats:**
- The model decides what to put there, and if it records something false or outdated, that will persist until manually corrected. `.agentic/memory.md` is a plain text file: you can edit or delete it yourself at any time.
- `/forget` clears everything (RAM + disk file) in one command.
- No hard size limit, just a warning beyond ~3000 characters (the content is re-injected into **every** model call, better to stay concise).
- **Per-project scope:** `.agentic/memory.md` lives in the current project folder, so memory is not shared between different projects.

---

## Live settings (`/parameters`)

A full-screen menu (in the style of `htop`/`raspi-config`) for adjusting live everything that
used to be hard-coded. Navigate with **↑/↓** between rows, **←/→** to adjust the value,
**`r`** to reset the selected one to its default, **`q`**/Enter to exit. A help line at the
bottom explains the currently selected parameter.

**33 parameters, 3 sections:**

- **Model Generation (8)**: Temperature, Top P, Top K, Repeat Penalty, Max Output Tokens,
  Seed, and **Stream Final Answer** (stream the final answer live; can be disabled if a model
  regresses on tool-calling while streaming).
- **Context & Safety Limits (16)**: context cap (**64K**), max tool rounds, **turn time
  budget** (`TURN_BUDGET_SECONDS`, 0 = off: when set and reached, the agent answers from what
  it already gathered instead of returning nothing), max background
  processes, max self-check re-prompts, max fake-tool-call retries, max citation reminders,
  max anti-hypothetical-fabrication nudges, max unsupported-values nudges
  (`_grounding_check`), max claimed-without-action nudges, tolerated tool refusals during the
  architect phase (`MAX_READONLY_REFUSALS`), `search_semantic` result count, indexing chunk
  size, and **context compaction** (`AUTO_COMPACT` on/off, `COMPACT_THRESHOLD_PCT` threshold,
  `COMPACT_KEEP_TURNS` recent turns kept).
- **Web Search (9)**: search language, number of results kept, `search_web_deep` settings
  (pages actually read, character budget per page, timeout before giving up, thin-content
  threshold), how many answer sections one search covers (`MAX_SECTIONS`), the
  never-converging deep-search circuit breaker (`MAX_DEEP_SEARCHES`), and the RSS fallback
  toggle.

```
You → /parameters
```

yes Changes are saved automatically (`~/.agentic_1a_params.json`) and reloaded on every launch
,  no need to re-tune everything each session.

---

## Context management

When a conversation gets very long it eventually fills the model's context window (**64K
tokens** by default, tunable). Three tools:

- **`/context`**: see where you stand: tokens actually used (Ollama's real
  `prompt_eval_count`, not an estimate) vs the cap, and the percentage.
- **`/compact`**: compact now, on demand. Two stages, an approach drawn from research
  (LangChain, Zylos, Claude Code, Factory.ai…):
  1. **lossless cleanup**: truncate old bulky tool results (free, no model call);
  2. if needed, a **structured summary** (`## Goal / ## Files changed / ## Key decisions /
     ## Open problems / ## Next steps`) of the older turns: the system prompt and the **last
     3 turns** are kept verbatim, never cut in the middle of a tool call.
- **Auto-compaction** (`/parameters` → *Auto-Compact Context*), **OFF by default, on
  purpose.** The community's main complaint is auto-compaction that destroys working context
  by surprise, so nothing compacts until you enable it. Once enabled, it triggers when the
  context passes `COMPACT_THRESHOLD_PCT` (70% by default, early, because a model near its cap
  summarises less well).

> Note: Important facts should never depend on the summary (which is lossy by nature): ask the
> agent to record durable decisions with `memory_write` (persistent), and it can find code by
> meaning again with `search_semantic`.

---

## How tool calls are displayed

By default each tool call prints one line while the agent works:

```
  search_web("npm shai hulud worm 2026")                  4.2 KB  1.8s
  read_file("agentic/loop.py")                           56.1 KB  0.1s
  run_command("rm -rf /")                                 blocked  0.0s
```

The name, the argument that identifies the call, how much came back, and how long it
took. The line appears the moment the call starts and is completed when it returns, so a
slow fetch is visible while it runs rather than only afterwards. The final answer is
printed in full, unchanged.

**`/details`** then prints everything that line left out, for the turn just finished:
every call, its full arguments, and its complete result.

```
You → /details          # all calls from the last turn
You → /details 2        # just the second one
```

This loses nothing compared with the old display. It gains: set **Tool Call Display** to
`full` in `/parameters` for the original two-panel view, and note that those panels cut
each result at 300 characters and discard the rest, so `full` actually shows *less* of a
large result than `/details` does. The record covers the most recent turn only.

---

## Privacy & logs

**What is written to disk in a normal session** (`--private` turns all of it off, see below):

| What | Where | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Full conversation** | `<project>/.agentic/sessions/<timestamp>.json` | Every message (you + model + tools), powers `/resume` |
| **Typed lines** | `~/.agentic_1a_history` | Everything you type at the prompt (messages + commands), **across all projects** |
| **Audit log** | `<project>/.agentic/audit_YYYYMMDD.log` | Every tool call: name + truncated arguments (≈250 chars: queries, paths, start of written content) |
| **Snapshots** | `<project>/.agentic/snapshots/*.bak` | A copy of a file before editing (file content) |
| **Git checkpoints** | `<project>/.agentic/checkpoints.git` | Project state before each write (file content) |
| **Persistent memory** | `<project>/.agentic/memory.md` | Facts the model explicitly recorded (`memory_write`) |
| **Background logs** | `<project>/.agentic/bg_logs/*.log` | Output of processes started with `run_background` |

> Unrelated to the conversation: `semantic_index.db` (code embeddings, for `search_semantic`)
> and `model_categories.json` (a model-metadata cache).

**Clearing existing logs** (nothing is deleted automatically):

```bash
# One project's conversation + audit + snapshots/checkpoints:
rm -rf ~/path/to/project/.agentic/sessions
rm -f  ~/path/to/project/.agentic/audit_*.log
rm -rf ~/path/to/project/.agentic/snapshots ~/path/to/project/.agentic/checkpoints.git
rm -f  ~/path/to/project/.agentic/memory.md          # if you also want to forget the memory

# The global input history (everything you typed, all projects):
rm -f  ~/.agentic_1a_history
```

In-session, **`/forget`** clears persistent memory and **`/undo`** reverts file writes. (Note:
`/clear` only empties the **in-memory** history; it does not delete the session file on disk.)

**Private session, nothing is logged, everything disappears on exit:**

```bash
bash launch.sh ~/my/project --private
# (alias: --incognito)
```

In `--private` mode **no trace of the conversation is written**: no session file, no input
history (`~/.agentic_1a_history`, in-memory only), no audit log, no disk snapshots, no git
checkpoints, no memory. A  banner confirms it at startup, and **`/private`** shows the state
at any time. `/undo` still works (RAM snapshots) for the duration of the session.

Note: **What private mode does NOT hide** (in the interest of honesty): the **real file changes**
the agent makes in your project are genuine changes on disk (use `/undo` before quitting to
revert them if needed); **settings** (`/parameters`, models) are still saved (they are not
conversation); and **web searches** still hit the network (SearXNG/DuckDuckGo). Private mode
is about **local on-disk logs**, not the network.

### Your IP address, when the agent goes online

Inference is local and your conversation never leaves the machine. Three tools do reach
the internet, and when they do, **your IP address is visible to whatever they contact**:

| Tool | Who sees your IP |
|---|---|
| `search_web`, `search_web_deep` | the engines your SearXNG queries upstream, or DuckDuckGo on failover |
| `fetch_url`, `fetch_url_rendered` | the site being read, directly |
| An MCP server you configured | wherever that server sends its traffic |

Self-hosting SearXNG already helps: the upstream engines see a search with no account and
no cookies attached to you, rather than a query tied to a logged-in profile. What it does
not do is hide where the request came from.

If that matters for your work, run the machine behind a **VPN or Tor**. Be clear about
what this buys: it substitutes the exit node's address for yours. The exit operator can
see the same traffic your ISP would have, so it moves the exposure rather than removing
it. Choose accordingly, and note that some sites block known VPN ranges, which shows up
here as searches or page fetches failing rather than as an error mentioning the VPN.

For an entirely offline session, do not use the web tools. Everything else, including
local RAG over your code, works with no network at all.

## Skills: reusable workflows

A **skill** is a reusable set of instructions for a type of task (writing a commit message,
doing a security review, generating a report in your format…). It is simply a folder with a
**`SKILL.md`** file, **the same open format as Claude Code / Cursor / Codex**, so skills are
portable.

**How it works (progressive disclosure, 3 levels):**
- At startup the agent reads only each skill's **name + description** (near-zero cost) and lists them in its system prompt.
- When a task matches, the **model loads** the full instructions itself (the `load_skill` tool), **or** you load them by hand with **`/skill <name>`**.
- The instructions can point to other files in the skill's folder; the agent reads them on demand.

```
You → /skills                 # list available skills + their descriptions
You → /skill commit-message   # load a skill into context for your next request
```

**Where to put your skills** (most specific wins on a name clash):

| Location | Scope |
|---|---|
| `<Ollamancer repo>/skills/` | **14 bundled skills** (see below) |
| `~/.agentic_1a_skills/` | **Your global skills** (all projects), created at startup |
| `<project>/.agentic/skills/` | Project-specific skills |

**Bundled skills (15)**: type `/skills` to see them with their descriptions:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test-and-fix` | Runs the tests, diagnoses failures, fixes, re-runs until green |
| `debug-error` | Debugs an error/traceback: reproduce → locate → fix → verify |
| `write-tests-for` | Writes real unit tests (happy path + edge cases + errors) and makes them pass |
| `security-review` | Audits code/diff for **real** security flaws, with a fix |
| `optimize-performance` | Measures first (profiling), applies the highest-impact fix, proves the gain |
| `dependency-audit` | Finds vulnerable/outdated dependencies (`pip-audit`, `npm audit`…), proposes updates |
| `explain-codebase` | Explores and explains the architecture of an unfamiliar project |
| `dockerize-project` | Writes a correct Dockerfile + `.dockerignore`, builds and verifies it runs |
| `changelog-from-git` | Generates a CHANGELOG / release notes from the real git history |
| `web-research-report` | Sourced web research → Markdown report with citations |
| `web-answer-format` | Shapes a web answer into sections matching the question (news, comparison, how-to…) — auto-loaded on web-shaped questions |

# Security review

## Steps
1. Read the diff with git_diff.
2. Check for: injection, hardcoded secrets, missing authz, unsafe deserialization…
3. Report only real issues (ignore false positives), each with file:line and a fix.
```
- `name`: lowercase/digits/hyphens, ≤ 64 characters.
- `description`: **the most important field**. It is what the model uses to decide whether to load the skill. Be precise about *when* to use it.
- The body can point to other files in the folder (`reference.md`, `scripts/…`), the agent reads them with `read_file` and runs them with `run_command`.

> Skills vs MCP: a **skill** says *how* to approach a task (workflow, judgement); an **MCP
> server** gives *access* to tools/data. They are complementary.

## Tool reference

###  Web search (`search_web` / `search_web_deep`)

Uses your local SearXNG instance. The tool detects news-type queries itself (keywords like
"news", "today", "breaking", "latest") and automatically switches to the SearXNG "news"
category (real dated articles) instead of "general", invisible to the model, one tool to
remember. Automatic fallback if the chosen category returns nothing usable, including an
invisible failover to the `duckduckgo` MCP server when SearXNG returns nothing at all.

**Two tools, two uses:**
- **`search_web`**: fast, returns snippets (~300 characters). Good for an overview or for deciding what to dig into.
- **`search_web_deep`**: slower, but **actually reads** the top 3 results in parallel (not just their snippets). Use it whenever the answer needs verifiable facts (precise news, figures, quotes). Each source comes back with its **publication date** (when found) and the **number of engines that independently confirm it**, e.g. `[confirmed by 2 sources: duckduckgo news, bing news]`, so you can judge freshness and reliability without guessing.

The model picks between them itself.

```
You → What's the weather in Paris today?
You → What's the latest news about Apple?
You → Search for tutorials on Python AI agents
```

###  Reading a web page (`fetch_url` / `fetch_url_rendered`)

`fetch_url` retrieves raw HTML without executing JavaScript, on a single-page app it sees
only the empty shell (or the unexecuted `<script>` source, which can look like text when it
isn't). `fetch_url_rendered` opens a real headless Chromium (Playwright), lets the JS run,
then reads the content actually displayed. Slower (~5-10s), so the model is instructed to try
`fetch_url` first and only escalate when the result looks empty/incomplete.

Requires `playwright` + `playwright install chromium` (optional dependency). Without it, the
tool simply reports itself unavailable rather than crashing.

```
You → Read this article: https://example.com/article
You → Summarise this page (it's a React app): https://example.com
```

###  Reading files (`read_file` / `read_file_lines`)

```
You → Read src/config.yml and explain the configuration
You → Read lines 45 to 80 of src/main.py
You → Show me the function around line 120 of utils.py
```

### Writing files (`write_file` / `append_file` / `edit_file`)

`write_file` creates or replaces a file; `append_file` adds to the end (and is how large files
are written in chunks); `edit_file` surgically replaces one precise block without rewriting
the rest.

Since v2.9.20, `write_file`/`edit_file` automatically check (via `ast.parse`) that the
resulting `.py` file is syntactically valid, and add a clear warning to the return message if
it isn't, without blocking the write. Since v2.9.18, a failed `edit_file` gives a real hint:
if it finds a close-enough passage (`difflib`) to your `old_text` elsewhere in the file, it
shows you that real passage with its line number.

```
You → Create a todo.md with a task list for this week
You → In main.py, replace get_user() with a version that validates the email
You → Fix the typo in README.md: "instalation" → "installation"
```

###  Running commands (`run_command` / `run_tests` / `python_repl`)

```
You → What Python version is installed?
You → Run the tests and tell me what fails
You → Run pytest and fix the errors
```

###  Searching code (`search_in_files` / `find_files` / `find_references` / `search_semantic`)

- `search_in_files`: pattern across every project file (`grep -rn`).
- `find_files`: files by name or glob pattern.
- `find_references`: understands code instead of just matching text: separates real definitions/imports from actual uses, and ignores mentions in comments/docstrings (exact on `.py` via AST, best-effort elsewhere).
- `search_semantic`: conceptual search by meaning (local RAG).

```
You → Where is parse_user() defined?
You → Before renaming calculate_total, show me everything that uses it with find_references
You → Where is the retry logic handled?
```

###  Quick check (`lint_file`)

Runs a fast static check on a single file (much faster than `run_tests`): `ruff`/`flake8` for
Python (falling back to `py_compile` if neither is installed), `eslint` for JS/TS (if
installed as a local devDependency), `go vet` for Go.

###  Git (`git_status` / `git_diff` / `git_log` / `git_commit`)

```
You → What's the state of the git repo?
You → Show me what changed since the last commit
You → Commit the changes with the message "feat: add email validation"
  (the model will run git add automatically via run_command before committing)
```

###  Other

`get_datetime` (current date and time, the model is required to call it before any
"today"/"current" search rather than guessing), `create_directory`, `list_directory`,
`analyze_image`, `python_repl`, `load_skill`, `todo_write`/`todo_read`,
`memory_write`/`memory_read`, `run_background`/`check_process`/`kill_process`/`list_processes`.

---

## Safety: checkpoints & undo

### `/diff`: see what changed

```
You → /diff
```
Shows a unified diff (like `git diff`) between the original files and their current state.

### `/undo`: restore a checkpoint

A **shadow git repository** (`<project>/.agentic/checkpoints.git`) snapshots the project
before the first write of each turn. It works even in projects that are not git repos, and it
never touches your own git history.

```
You → /undo          # list the available checkpoints
You → /undo last     # restore the most recent one
You → /undo 3        # restore checkpoint number 3
```

> Each checkpoint corresponds to the state **before a turn's first write**, so `/undo last`
> reverts the whole of the last turn's changes, not just the last individual edit.

### Safe mode and the sandbox

- **`/safe`** (or `--safe`), `write_file`, `append_file`, `edit_file`, `run_command`, `run_tests`, `run_background`, `kill_process`, `git_commit` and `python_repl` ask for `[y/N]` approval before running. Enter alone = refusal (it fails on the cautious side). MCP tools are also treated as risky. Off by default.
- **`/sandbox`** (or `--sandbox`), runs `run_command`/`run_tests`/`python_repl` inside an isolated Docker container instead of on the host. Orthogonal to safe mode: `/safe` gates *approval*, the sandbox contains the *blast radius*. If Docker is unavailable while the sandbox is on, the command is refused rather than silently run on the host.

---

## Code context: `/add` `/files` `/drop`

Inject files into the model's context before asking questions about them.

```bash
# Inject one or more files
You → /add src/main.py src/utils.py

# See what's in context
You → /files

# Stop tracking one
You → /drop utils.py
```

After `/add`, the model knows the content with line numbers. You can then:

```
You → Explain the main() function we just injected
You → Optimise the UserService class
You → Are there any bugs in this code?
```

---

## Planning: `/plan`

Ask the model to plan a task WITHOUT executing it. It explains its approach, the files
involved, and the risks.

```
You → /plan Refactor the auth module to use JWT
You → /plan Add unit tests to the UserService class
You → /plan Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
```

Then, to execute it:
```
You → OK go ahead, execute that plan
```

> For a stronger version of this, `/architect <task>` runs the plan phase on one model
> (read-only tools) and the execution on another (all tools).

---

## A typical coding workflow

```bash
# 1. Launch from the project folder
cd ~/projects/my-project
bash /path/to/Ollamancer/launch.sh

# 2. Explore the project
You → Show me the project structure
You → Find where the UserController class is defined

# 3. Plan before acting
You → /plan Add a POST /users endpoint with email validation

# 4. Inject the relevant files
You → /add src/routes/users.py src/models/user.py

# 5. Ask for the changes
You → Add the POST /users endpoint with email validation as planned

# 6. Check the changes
You → /diff
You → Run the tests: pytest

# 7. Commit if OK
You → Commit with "feat: add POST /users endpoint"

# 8. Revert if there's a problem
You → /undo last
```

---

## Switching models

### Via the interactive list (recommended)

```
You → /model
```

Shows a numbered table of every model from `ollama list`, with:

- **Size / Params**: from `ollama list`.
- **Usage**: Light / Medium / Heavy / Very heavy, computed from the RAM actually detected on the machine, not a fixed value. `` = MoE model (name containing `-aXb`, e.g. `30b-a3b`) → runs faster than its raw size suggests.
- **Task**: what the model is best at (Code, Agentic, Research/RAG, Generalist…). It first uses a local knowledge base built into the agent; if a model is unknown, the agent runs a SearXNG search on its name and infers the category by keywords, then caches the result in `.agentic/model_categories.json` (searched once per model). Note: This automatic categorisation is a keyword heuristic, not an AI judgement, reliable when the model is well documented online, but it can be wrong on an obscure or poorly indexed name.
- **Tools** ✓/✗, tool-calling support.
- **Active**: the model currently loaded.

Type the number (e.g. `3`) or part of the name (e.g. `qwen3`) to switch, or leave it empty to
cancel.

A model marked **Tools ✗** is refused automatically (error message, no switch): the agent
needs tool calling to work, so those models (e.g. pure embedding models like `bge-m3`) are not
selectable.

### Directly by name

```
You → /model qwen3.5:4b
```

### Model recommendations

Any tool-capable Ollama model works. Scores below are out of 100 from the ranking campaign in
[`benchmarks/model_ranking/RESULTS.md`](./benchmarks/model_ranking/RESULTS.md): four tasks
(reasoning, web search, agentic work, report writing) on a 24 GB Apple Silicon machine.
**Scores are `pass^2`: the minimum across two runs**, so a model counts only what it delivers
every time. All totals are final: the hand-judged items were completed on 2026-08-11. A score marked ²
was never given a second run and is not comparable to the rest. ³ `qwen-heretic:latest` is a
**local tag**, not something you can `ollama pull`: it is
`Qwen3.5-9B-The-Defiant-Fable-Uncnr-Heretic-NEO-MAX-Q4_K_M.gguf` imported from a local file.
Every other model listed here can be pulled by the name shown.

| Model | Size | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen-heretic` ³ (Qwen3.5-9B) | 7.0 GB | **87** | Best agentic *and* best report score tested: fixed *and* verified the broken program on both runs. Zero swap |
| `gemma4:12b-mlx` | 7.7 GB | **79** | **Recommended default.** Second-highest average, and the strongest reasoner, but it fixed the broken program on only one of two runs |
| `gpt-oss:20b` | 13 GB | 75 | Best planner and best report prose; natively supported by Ollama; 0 timeouts, 0 swap, and the *same score on both runs* |
| `gemma4:e4b-mlx` ² | 8.8 GB | 80 | Matches a 13 GB model at 8.8 GB. Skips `get_datetime` unless told to, so say "check the date first" for date-bounded questions |
| `qwen3.5:4b` | 3.4 GB | 67 | The shipped fallback: strong web search at the smallest size, zero swap |
| `hf.co/deepreinforce-ai/Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF:Q4_K_M` | 5.6 GB | 66 | Strong reasoning, but timed out on 4 of 8 runs |
| `hf.co/HauhauCS/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B…:IQ2_M` | 12.6 GB | 70 | A 35B MoE that actually fits: zero swap, and it timed out less often than the top-scoring model |
| `jikepjikep_16HEX/gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic…` | 7.4 GB | 57 | Uncensored (Heretic); perfect search score |
| `Agen/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-uncensored-heretic` | 18 GB | 56 | Uncensored + vision, and perfect reasoning, but ~16 GB of swap on a 24 GB machine |

> **Do not use the nvfp4 MLX builds.** `qwen3.5:9b-mlx` scored **10** and `qwen3.5:4b-mlx`
> scored **28**, against 87 and 67 for the same base models in Q4. Neither swaps; the 9B one
> simply fails to finish, timing out on 6 of 8 runs. Suspected runtime issue (both require
> Ollama 0.19.0), not yet isolated.

> Note: **Buy memory headroom before precision.** `gemma4:e4b-mlx` (4-bit, 8.8 GB) beat its
> own unquantised twin `gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16` (16 GB) by 29 points. The extra 7.2 GB bought
> swap, not quality: 2.7x slower search for an identical result, and no report at all.
>
> Note: **On 24 GB, dense models above ~13 GB are a poor trade.** `gemma4:26b-mlx` pushed
> **18.9 GB into swap** across 8 runs and still scored below a 7.0 GB model. A 27B+ model at q8
> may not load at all, Ollama refused one outright with *"requires 26.6 GiB but only 17.3 GiB
> are available"*. The 26B models are not stupid — they score a **perfect 25/25 on reasoning**,
> beating every smaller model — they just page so heavily that they never finish the longer
> tasks. A **mixture-of-experts is the exception**: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` activates ~3B parameters
> per token, so at 12.6 GB it fits, swaps nothing, and times out less than the top-ranked model.

> Note: Models that do not support tool calling are not compatible, and `/model` blocks selecting
> them. Models "uncensored" via classic abliteration (`huihui_ai/*`) showed repeated factual
> fabrication under pressure, prefer the **Heretic** method if you need an uncensored model.

## iMessage bridge: control from an iPhone

Send commands to the agent from your iPhone via iMessage. **macOS only**, and entirely
optional.

### Setup (first time only)
```bash
cd /path/to/Ollamancer && .venv/bin/python imessage_bridge.py --setup
```
It will ask for your own phone number or iCloud email, the one you will message from.

**Prerequisites:** System Settings → Privacy → Full Disk Access → Terminal ✓, Messages.app
open on the Mac, Ollama running.

### Running the bridge
```bash
cd /path/to/Ollamancer && .venv/bin/python imessage_bridge.py
```
The bridge stops when you close the terminal. There is no need to leave it running
permanently.

### Usage

1. Open **Messages** on the iPhone.
2. Send a message to **your own number** (the one configured at setup).
3. The message must start with `!`.

```
! what time is it
! list the project files
! search for the latest AI news
```

> Without the leading `!`, the bridge ignores the message.

**Behaviour:** the bridge replies in the same iMessage conversation; long messages are split
into fragments automatically; a `⏳` is sent immediately as an acknowledgement; the answer
arrives within a few seconds depending on complexity.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Ollama is not running"
```bash
ollama serve
# then relaunch the agent in another terminal
```

### "Model not found"
```bash
ollama list                                  # what's available
ollama pull gemma4:12b-mlx                   # or any tool-capable model
```

### Search errors (`search_web`)
```bash
# Check SearXNG
curl "http://localhost:8080/search?q=test&format=json"
```
If you don't run SearXNG, `search_web` automatically fails over to the `duckduckgo` MCP server
when one is configured, see the MCP section of [`capabilities.md`](./capabilities.md).

### The agent doesn't answer / is very slow
- The model is thinking, the "Thinking…" spinner with the live RAM readout is normal.
- Press **Esc** to stop it and get back to the prompt. Note that what the model had gathered
  so far is discarded — Esc is a cancel, not a "wrap up now".
- For faster answers, switch to a smaller model with `/model`.
- **There is no time limit by default.** A local model on a busy machine can take many minutes;
  nothing cuts it off. If you would rather have a partial answer than a long wait, set
  **Turn Time Budget** in `/parameters` (e.g. 600 seconds). When it trips, the agent stops
  calling tools and spends one last generation answering from what it already found, clearly
  marked incomplete — it does not return empty.
- The same now applies to the **tool-round limit**. Hitting it used to end the turn with
  "Stopped after N tool-call rounds" and nothing else; it now produces a partial answer the
  same way.

### The turn ended with "Unexpected error:"

Something raised inside the turn. The session is fine and your earlier messages are intact —
only that one turn is lost.

- The message names the exception type. If it also has a description, that is the model's or
  Ollama's own wording.
- The **full traceback is in `.agentic/audit.log`** (not written under `--private`). That is the
  thing to read, or to paste into an issue.
- If it repeats on the same request: narrow the request, `/clear` for a fresh turn, or `/model`
  to switch. A repeating failure on one specific model is usually an Ollama tool-call parsing
  bug — the agent retries those automatically, and reports when the retries are exhausted.

### Python import error
```bash
cd /path/to/Ollamancer
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Rebuild the environment from scratch
```bash
cd /path/to/Ollamancer
rm -rf .venv
bash launch.sh
```

---

## Advanced tips

### Multi-step requests
The agent chains several tools automatically:
```
You → Find the current Bitcoin price, compare it with a week ago from another
      source, and write a summary to bitcoin.md
```

### Carrying file context through a conversation
```
You → Read src/main.py
You → Optimise the parse_data() function you just read
You → Save the improved version to src/main_v2.py
```

### "System engineer" mode
```
You → Check whether git is installed, show me the version, and list the repos here
```

### Keeping a long session on track
The context window is **64K tokens** by default. Use `/context` to see how full it is,
`/compact` to compact on demand, and `/clear` only when you genuinely want to start over.
Durable facts belong in `memory_write`, not in the conversation history.

## Appendix: version history

> This is a condensed summary. The full engineering history, with the reasoning and the
> benchmark evidence behind each change, is in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md).

**v3.1 (2026-08-15).** Reliability and honesty of the *reporting*, after an audit found the
benchmark had been scoring failed runs as successes.

- **A turn that runs out now answers instead of returning nothing.** Hitting the tool-round
  limit, or the new optional `TURN_BUDGET_SECONDS` wall clock, used to discard everything the
  turn had gathered and print a status line. The agent now spends one final generation, with
  tools disabled, answering from the evidence already collected and stating what is missing.
  The grounding check still runs on it and warns. **32 live settings.**
- **No more bare `Unexpected error:`.** The turn-level catch-alls printed the message and
  nothing else whenever an exception carried no text. They now always name the exception type,
  explain that the session survived, and write the full traceback to the audit log.
- **The claim-vs-action nudge no longer fires on research turns**, where "verified" means
  checked against the sources and no verification tool could have run.
- **Benchmark scorer fixed:** a timed-out run recorded `status: "ok"` and was scored on the file
  it had left behind, so runs producing nothing scored up to 25/25. Correcting it moved 42 of
  135 runs; the model ranked first fell from 87.0 to eleventh place. See `RESULTS.md` §11.
- **The honesty layer is now measured, not assumed.** `_grounding_check` had never fired in 264
  benchmark runs, which is equally consistent with a calibrated check and a dead one; its
  sensitivity is now pinned at 91/91 on injected fabrications.
- **Docs check their own numbers.** Six hand-maintained counts had drifted; `test_structure`
  now verifies tools, settings, skills, tests, modules and line counts against the repo.
- **42 offline tests** (from 36).

**v3.0 (2026-08-05), major release.** 7 fixes + 10 features.
- **5 new tools:** `append_file` (chunked writes, anti-truncation), `search_semantic` (local RAG via bge-m3), `analyze_image` (vision), `python_repl` (persistent interpreter), `load_skill`. **34 tools total.**
- **New commands:** `/architect`, `/architect-models`, `/review-by`, `/resume`, `/failover-model`, `/vision-model`, `/context`, `/compact`, `/skills`, `/skill`, `/private`.
- **`/undo` reworked** into a list of git checkpoints instead of all-or-nothing undo.
- **Streaming final answers**, automatic **session persistence**, invisible **DuckDuckGo search failover**, an **encoding fix** (no more `â€™`), a **closest-path hint** on file-not-found, and **deterministic honesty layers** (unsupported values, claimed-fixed-without-action).
- **Headless mode**: `--run "prompt"` and `--recipe file.md` (exit code = success).
- Context cap doubled to **64K** plus **context compaction** (auto off by default), **slash-command autocomplete**, **Esc-to-stop**, and **`--private`** ephemeral mode.
- **Skills**: reusable `SKILL.md` workflows with progressive disclosure, plus a 15-skill library.

**v2.9.x, the reliability series.** Safe mode (v2.9); real context negotiation with Ollama,
a thin-search circuit breaker and a no-guessing-the-date rule (v2.9.4); empty-response retries
for "thinking" models (v2.9.5); anti-fabrication prompt rules (v2.9.6,.7); `search_web_deep`
(v2.9.9); `/parameters` (v2.9.10); the web-search quality overhaul, `trafilatura`,
robots.txt, caching, honest User-Agent (v2.9.11); five reliability/ecosystem workstreams,
fake-tool-call detection, persisted settings, citation reminders, **MCP support**, **Docker
sandbox** (v2.9.14); MCP progress notifications, more anti-fabrication rules, `prompt_toolkit`
input, a persisted user-chosen default model (v2.9.15); **a path-confinement security fix**
plus three research-driven fixes (v2.9.16); the anti-hypothetical-tool-output nudge (v2.9.17);
the `edit_file` near-match hint (v2.9.18); "a clean lint is not proof" (v2.9.19); automatic
post-write syntax checking (v2.9.20).

**v2.2, v2.8, the tool-belt years.** English-by-default bilingual interface (v2.2);
`lint_file` + the self-correction loop + the 25-round guard (v2.3); `todo_write`/`todo_read`
(v2.4); background processes (v2.5); `fetch_url_rendered` via Playwright (v2.6);
`memory_write`/`memory_read` persistent memory (v2.7); `find_references` with real AST
analysis (v2.8).
