"""Ollamancer — settings (user configuration, persisted).

This module holds the **tunable** values: config paths, model choices, generation
parameters, web-search settings, and the loop guardrails. All 32 settings exposed by
`/parameters` live here and are persisted to `PARAMS_FILE`.

⚠️ IMPORT RULE (enforced by tests/test_import_rules.py) — these values are **rebound at
runtime** (the /parameters menu, /lang, /architect-models, /vision-model…). So always go
through the module; never import the names:

    from agentic import config      # ✅
    config.STREAM_FINAL             # ✅ resolved on every access

    from agentic.config import STREAM_FINAL   # ❌ frozen copy: will never see a change

Non-persisted runtime state (project folder, safe mode, current session…) lives in
`agentic/state.py`, not here.
