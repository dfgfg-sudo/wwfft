"""Ollamancer — the ReAct loop and its honesty layers.

`run_agent` is the heart: the model thinks, calls tools, reads the results, and repeats until
it can answer without a tool. Everything else in this module exists because that loop meets
small local models, which fail in specific, repeatable ways.

**Plumbing retries.** Five distinct upstream failure signatures, each needing its own branch
because a generic "retry on error" would mask what is happening: a bad auto-generated parser
(ollama#16988), the model drifting from its own tool-call format (#14834/#16383/#16810), the
argument JSON truncated mid-generation, a pseudo tool call emitted as plain text, and a prompt
that overflows num_ctx so the user's own instruction is trimmed away before the model sees it. Three of
these were first mistaken for model incompetence — the task was never attempted at all. When
retries are exhausted, a one-time model failover takes over rather than losing the turn.

**Empty answers.** A "thinking" model can produce a full reasoning trace and stop, never
converting it into content. The loop re-prompts before giving up, and never shows an empty
panel without explanation.

**Honesty nudges**, all deterministic and all capped, because each can false-positive:

  * `_grounding_check` — extracts the hard tokens (numbers, dates, URLs, quoted names) from
    the final answer and substring-searches them in this turn's raw tool results. Anything
    present in the answer but in no result gets flagged. No LLM, no semantics.
  * `_claim_without_action` — the answer claims "fixed"/"verified" but no edit and no
    verification happened this turn. This one exists because a model declared a bug fixed on
    a file that was bit-for-bit identical to the original. The "verified" half stands down on
    a turn built from research tools alone, where the word means checked against the sources
    and no verification tool could ever have run.
  * thin-search and deep-search circuit breakers, the citation reminder, and the
    stuck-verification nudge that pushes toward searching when the same error repeats.

They **nudge, never gate**: each adds a message and re-runs the loop. None rewrites or
suppresses what the model produced — a censoring layer would hide the failure instead of
surfacing it.

Say that precisely, though, because the slogan is kinder than the mechanism. A nudge re-runs
the loop, so the answer that reaches the screen is the *second* one; the first is appended to
`messages` and superseded, with nothing on screen marking that it existed. It survives in the
conversation and in the saved session JSON (not under `--private`), but no command prints it —
`/details` records tool calls, not answers. Nothing is censored and something can still be lost
from view, which is why a nudge firing on a false premise is expensive rather than merely
noisy: it spends a correct answer. See `_claim_without_action` for the case where that
happened, and DESIGN.md §4.2b for the general rule it produced.

**Compaction** runs in two stages on the real `prompt_eval_count`, not an estimate: lossless
truncation of old tool results first (free), then a structured summary of older turns, cutting
only at turn boundaries so a tool message is never orphaned from its assistant(tool_calls).

    Both ways a turn can run out used to discard everything. The round limit returned the string
    "maximum tool rounds reached"; a benchmark timeout returned six characters. In the model
    ranking that happened to 50 of 135 runs — one of them after 35 successful tool calls, whose
    results were read, useful, and thrown away. The user waited eight minutes for a sentence
    explaining that there would be no answer.

    Graceful degradation is the standard shape here, and the phrasing in the literature is
    exact: the difference is between a useful 80% answer and a useless 0% one. So instead of
    returning a status line, the model is asked once more — with **no tools**, so it cannot
    start another search it has no budget for — to answer from the evidence already in the
    conversation and to be explicit about what is missing.

    Two things this deliberately does not do:

    * **It does not hide that the turn was cut short.** The answer is framed as incomplete, in
      the prompt and on screen. An 80% answer presented as a whole one is worse than the status
      line it replaces, because the reader cannot tell which parts are thin.
    * **It does not skip the honesty layer.** Forcing an answer out of partial evidence is
      precisely the condition that produces fabrication — retrieval failures, not model
      failures, are what most hallucination traces back to — so this is the *last* place to stop
      checking. `_grounding_check` is pure string matching and costs nothing, so it still runs.
      What it cannot do is nudge: a nudge is another full generation and the budget is gone.

    That one is a convenience: keep the context tidy once it passes a threshold, off by
    default. This one is a correctness guard, because overflowing does not merely slow things
    down — Ollama makes room by dropping the OLDEST messages, and after the system prompt the
    oldest thing is the user's own instruction. It is the first thing deleted.

    What happens next depends only on the model's chat template. Two of the models tested here
    assert that a user message is present and refuse outright ("No user query found in
    messages"); every other one answers normally, from a conversation the request has been
    silently removed from. The refusal is the good case: it is visible. So the guard fires for
    every model, not just the ones that would complain.

    Two things this got wrong on the first attempt, both found in real use:

    The tool schemas are part of the prompt and were not counted. All 35 of them are ~5,800
    tokens, **18% of a 32K window before a single message exists**, so an 85% ceiling on a
    schema-blind estimate could not fire in time. They are measured now.

    And characters/4 is optimistic for the text this agent actually accumulates: search
    results are dense with URLs and punctuation, which tokenise closer to 3 characters each.
    The divisor stays at 4 in `_estimate_tokens` (it is used elsewhere for reporting), so the
