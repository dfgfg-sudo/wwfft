"""Ollamancer — skills (reusable SKILL.md workflows).

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md`: YAML frontmatter with a `name` and a
`description`, then free-form instructions. The format is the open standard shared with
Claude Code, Cursor and Codex, so skills are portable in both directions.

**Progressive disclosure, three tiers**, which is what keeps the cost near zero:

  1. *Discovery* — at startup only each skill's name and description go into the system
     prompt (`_skills_prompt_block`). A dozen skills cost a few hundred tokens.
  2. *Loading* — when a task matches, the model calls `load_skill` itself (or the user runs
     `/skill <name>`), and only then are the full instructions read.
  3. *Execution* — the instructions may point at other files in the skill folder, which the
     agent reads on demand with its ordinary file tools.

**One documented exception to tier 2**: `web-answer-format` is loaded code-side by
`_maybe_autoload_web_format` when the user's message is obviously a web question, because tier 2
assumes the model *chooses* to load, and on a small local model that assumption is the weak
link (same reasoning, and the same benchmark evidence, as the forced search in `tools/web.py`).
Every other skill still waits to be asked for.

Three sources, most specific wins on a name clash: bundled (`<repo>/skills/`), user-global
(`~/.agentic_1a_skills/`), and per-project (`<project>/.agentic/skills/`).

The frontmatter parser is deliberately minimal — `key: value` lines only, no YAML dependency
— and tolerates a missing frontmatter block rather than failing the whole discovery pass.

# *chooses* to call load_skill, and the benchmarks show a small local model mostly doesn't —
# it answers straight from the first search result, in one flat undated list. So for the one
# case where the output shape matters most (a question that will obviously be answered from
# the web), the load happens code-side, before the model gets its turn.

# prefix. An ordinary coding question is not caught, and shouldn't be — these are chat-answer
# formatting rules, not general ones. `latest` is the one loose term, it also fires on "upgrade
# to the latest pandas"; kept anyway, because it is the recency word users actually type, and
# the cost of a false positive is ~1.3k tokens (2% of the default 64K window), not a wrong
