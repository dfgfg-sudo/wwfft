"""Ollamancer — the tool belt.

One module per domain: `web`, `files`, `codenav`, `rag`, `vcs`, `exec`, `vision`, `notes`,
plus `load_skill` from `agentic/skills.py`. Each exposes the tools the model can call and the
private helpers that serve only them.

This file is the **registry**, and the single place a new tool has to be declared. `TOOLS` is
the list handed to Ollama, which derives each tool's JSON schema from the function's name,
type hints and docstring — so the docstring is not documentation, it is the interface the
model reads when deciding what to call.

Two subsets carve up `TOOLS` and both fail dangerously if they drift:

  * `_RISKY_TOOLS` (in `agentic/safety.py`) — gated behind safe-mode approval. A risky tool
    missing from it silently skips the prompt.
  * `_READ_ONLY_TOOL_NAMES` — what the architect phase is allowed to touch. A write tool
    leaking in would let a "read-only" planning pass modify the project.

`tests/test_structure.py` freezes all three sets and cross-checks them, so a tool lost or
miscategorised during a refactor fails the build rather than going quiet.
