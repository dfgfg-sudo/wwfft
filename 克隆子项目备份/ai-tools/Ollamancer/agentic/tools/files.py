"""Ollamancer — file reading, writing and editing.

The seven file tools, plus the hint machinery that makes them recoverable when a model gets
something slightly wrong. Those hints are not polish; each exists because a model burned a
session without it:

  * `_closest_path_hint` — on file-not-found, suggest the nearest real path (difflib). Added
    after a model repeatedly mistyped a long path and spent a whole session on "file not
    found" without ever correcting itself.
  * `_closest_snippet_hint` — on a failed `edit_file` match, show the closest real passage
    with its line number instead of "check your spelling". Two different models had looped on
    the same stale edit_file call for a long time.
  * `_python_syntax_warning` — after writing a .py file, `ast.parse` it and warn (never
    block) if invalid. Added after a model truncated its own output across eight full-file
    rewrites while `write_file` reported success every time.
  * `_large_write_note` — nudge toward chunked writes past ~80 lines: one huge tool-call
    argument is the most fragile operation in the stack (Ollama truncates the argument JSON
    mid-generation).
  * `_rename_consistency_warning` — flag a rename that left the old identifier behind.

Every path goes through `_check_file_path` first, which confines it to the project root.
