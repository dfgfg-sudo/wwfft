"""Ollamancer — image understanding.

One tool, `analyze_image`, which hands a picture to an installed multimodal model.

**Capability detection is real, not name-based.** `_model_has_vision` asks `ollama.show()` for
the declared capabilities; `_VISION_NAME_HINTS` is only a fallback for when that call fails.
Verified necessary in both directions on real installs: a `gemma-4-12B` variant matches the
name pattern but has no vision capability, and other models have it while matching none of the
expected names.

**Loading is sequential.** The main model is unloaded before the vision model is called, then
reloads next turn. Two resident models do not fit in 24 GB — a hard constraint, not an
optimisation. `_unload_model` is called through the `models` module rather than imported by
name, so a test patching `models._unload_model` reaches it.
