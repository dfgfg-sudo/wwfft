"""Ollamancer — web search and page fetching.

Four tools, and a lot of routing the model never sees.

**Search category is chosen in code, not by the model.** A query with news intent is routed to
SearXNG's `news` category instead of `general`. This was the root cause of an entire class of
fabrication: `general` legitimately ranks hub pages ("BBC News World") first for "top news
today", the model got no real articles, and it invented plausible headlines. The model still
sees one tool with one parameter — the same shape as Anthropic's own server-side `web_search`,
where routing is hidden.

**Failover is also invisible.** When SearXNG returns nothing usable — zero results, empty
CAPTCHA-shaped snippets, or a transport error — `search_web` falls back to the `duckduckgo`
MCP server itself. Benchmarks showed models never choose the MCP tool on their own.

**`search_web_deep` exists because models do not chain.** Across many transcripts, no tested
model spontaneously followed a promising `search_web` snippet with `fetch_url`; they stopped
at the snippet or re-searched. So deep search does both in one call, reading the top results
in parallel, and annotates each source with its publication date and how many engines
independently confirm it.

**`_maybe_force_search` is a code-side guarantee, not a prompt rule.** A message starting with
"search" runs the search before the model gets a turn, because a model was observed ignoring
an explicit instruction to search and answering from invented knowledge instead.

`fetch_url` reads raw HTML; `fetch_url_rendered` drives a real headless browser for
single-page apps, and is escalated to automatically when extracted text looks like an empty JS
shell rather than relying on the model to notice.
