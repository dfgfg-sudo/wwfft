# Ollamancer: Local Model Ranking

**Machine:** MacBook, Apple Silicon, 24 GB unified memory · **Date:** 8 August 2026, extended 10 and 11 August
**Harness:** Ollamancer OSS, 34 native tools, MCP disabled, `--private` mode
**Parameters (identical for every model):** temp 0.35 · top_p 0.95 · top_k 40 · **repeat_penalty 1.15** · num_ctx 32768 · num_predict 4096
**Scale:** 25 points per task · 5-minute hard cap per run. §1–§10 total all four to 100; **§11 reports a core of 75** (reasoning, search, report) with the agentic task separately, because 14 of 18 models score zero on it

> ### Read [section 11](#11-the-corrected-ranking-15-august-2026--read-this-instead-of-10) first
>
> **Sections 1–10 are superseded and should not be quoted.**
>
> §1–§9 are `pass^1`, one run per model per task. §10 added a second rep and scored `pass^k`,
> the minimum across reps: eight of ten models scored *lower*, one by 17 points.
>
> **§10 was then found to be wrong too.** A timed-out run recorded `status: "ok"` and was scored
> on the artifact it had left behind, so runs that produced nothing scored up to 25/25. Fixing
> it on 15 August moved 42 of 135 runs and cost fifteen of eighteen models points — the largest
> by 50, which took §10's first place to eleventh. §11 is the corrected ranking, and it reports
> a **core score out of 75** plus the agentic task separately, because 14 of 18 models score
> zero on that task and blending it into one total describes nothing.
>
> Every superseded section is kept unedited. The gap between a published ranking and its
> correction is the most useful thing in this file.

## 1. All-Purpose Ranking

| Rank | Model | Size | Reasoning | Search | Agentic | Report | **Total** |

### Reliability, the column that decides daily use

| Model | Timeouts (of 4) | Swap caused | Total time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **gpt-oss:20b** | **0** | **0 MB** | **492 s**, the fastest that also scores well |
| gamy316/aileen1.0 | 0 | 0 MB | 189 s, fastest overall, but the weakest answers |
| lfm2.5:8b | 0 | 0 MB | 482 s |
| qwen3.5:4b | 1 | 0 MB | 663 s |
| gemma4:12b-mlx | 1 | 7.9 GB | 805 s |
| Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | 2 | 0 MB | 887 s |
| Agen/gemma-4-26B | 2 | 8.7 GB | 1166 s |
| gemma4:26b-mlx | 2 | **13.2 GB** | 935 s |
| **ornith:9b** | **3** | 0 MB | 999 s |
| gemma-4-12b-heretic | **3** | 0 MB | 1076 s |

> **Warning:** `ornith:9b` was the default at the time of the run and it timed out on 3 of 4
> tasks. It should not be anyone's default.
>
> **Warning:** the two 17 GB models are not viable on 24 GB. `gemma4:26b-mlx` alone pushed
> **13.2 GB** into swap. That is SSD wear in exchange for scores *below* a 7.7 GB model.

## 2. Search Ranking

*Scored on: calling `get_datetime` before searching · reading pages rather than snippets ·
story count · outlet diversity · every URL verified against real tool output · no aggregators ·
no duplicated events.*

| Rank | Model | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **qwen3.5:4b** | **25/25** | Perfect. Dated first, deep-read, 3 outlets, all URLs real |
| 1 | **gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic** | **25/25** | Perfect, same profile |
| 1 | **Agen/gemma-4-26B-heretic** | **25/25** | Perfect, but 17 GB and 8.7 GB of swap to get there |
| 4 | gemma4:26b-mlx | 22 | Used snippets, did not deep-read |
| 5 | gemma4:12b-mlx | 20.7 | Snippets only, and 2 of 3 stories from the same outlet |
| 6 | gpt-oss:20b | 19 | Deep-read properly, but found only **2 stories from 1 outlet** |
| 6 | ornith:9b | 19 | Searched *before* checking the date |
| 8 | Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | 17 | Never called `get_datetime` |
| 8 | lfm2.5:8b | 17 | Never dated, and thin coverage |
| 10 | gamy316/aileen1.0 | 14.3 | Never dated, all stories from one outlet |

> **Zero fabricated URLs across all ten models.** Every citation matched real retrieved

> same shape appears in `PLAN.md` §3 (`status: "ok"` read as "the run answered") and
> `DESIGN.md` §4.2b (`had_verification` read as "the model did not check its work").
>
> **Best value:** `qwen3.5:4b`, a perfect search score from a **3.4 GB** model with zero swap.

## 3. Search and Report Ranking

*Combined T2 and T4, 50 points. The report task: research a live topic and write `report.md`
with 4 mandated sections in order, 350+ words, every claim carrying a citation that resolves
to a real retrieved URL.*

| Rank | Model | Search | Report | **Total /50** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **qwen3.5:4b** | 25 | 23.9 | **48.9** |
| 1 | **gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic** | 25 | 23.9 | **48.9** |
| 3 | **gemma4:12b-mlx** | 20.7 | 24.5 | **45.2** |
| 4 | gpt-oss:20b | 19 | **25** | 44.0 |
| 4 | ornith:9b | 19 | **25** | 44.0 |
| 6 | Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | 17 | 22.8 | 39.8 |
| 7 | Agen/gemma-4-26B | 25 | **0** | 25.0 |
| 8 | gemma4:26b-mlx | 22 | **0** | 22.0 |
| 9 | lfm2.5:8b | 17 | **0** | 17.0 |
| 10 | gamy316/aileen1.0 | 14.3 | **0** | 14.3 |

> **Four models never wrote the file at all.** They searched, discussed the report, and
> produced nothing. Both 17 GB models are in that group: they ran out of the 5-minute budget
> before writing.

**Best prose quality, judged by hand:** `gpt-oss:20b`, `ornith:9b` and `Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF`,
all 3/3. `ornith:9b` produced the richest report (778 words, and it correctly picked up the
August 2026 CHAINDROP/keyv wave). `qwen3.5:4b` cited `CVE-2026-45321`, which was **verified as
genuinely retrieved, not invented**.

## 4. Agentic Ranking

*The hardest test: a deliberately broken Python game with two real crash bugs. Read it, fix it,
and **run it to prove the fix**. Graded by an automated playthrough that exercises every menu
action. Pass or fail, no opinion involved.*

| Rank | Model | Playthrough | Bug 1 | Bug 2 | Ran the code | Tool calls | **Score** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **gemma4:12b-mlx** | **PASS** | fixed | fixed | yes | 13 | **25/25** |
| 2 | gemma-4-12b-heretic | FAIL | fixed | fixed | yes | 10 | 15 |
| 3 | gpt-oss:20b | FAIL | fixed | fixed | no | **25** | 12 |
| 4 | qwen3.5:4b | FAIL | fixed | missed | yes | 13 | 9 |
| 4 | Agen/gemma-4-26B | FAIL | missed | fixed | yes | 3 | 9 |
| 4 | gemma4:26b-mlx | FAIL | missed | fixed | yes | 4 | 9 |
| 4 | lfm2.5:8b | FAIL | missed | fixed | yes | 11 | 9 |
| 8 | Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | FAIL | missed | fixed | no | 1 | 6 |
| 8 | ornith:9b | FAIL | missed | fixed | no | 1 | 6 |
| 8 | gamy316/aileen1.0 | FAIL | missed | fixed | no | **0** | 6 |

> **Only `gemma4:12b-mlx` passed.** One model in ten.
>
> **Tool calls predict almost everything here.** The top four made 10 to 25 calls. The bottom
> three made 0 or 1 and simply *asserted* the code was fixed. `aileen1.0` made **zero tool
> calls** and declared victory.
>
> **Note:** `gpt-oss:20b` fixed both bugs and made the most tool calls of anyone, 25, but never
> executed the result. A strong planner that does not verify. It was also cut off by the
> 25-round ceiling in force at the time, so 12/25 understates it.

## 5. `/architect`: Best Model Pairings

`/architect` runs a **planner** (read-only) and an **executor** (full tools), loaded **one at a
time**. Combined size therefore never has to fit in RAM at once, only the larger of the two.

### Agentic and coding work

| Role | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | `gpt-oss:20b` | The best planner measured: 25 tool calls, found *both* bugs, 0 timeouts, 0 swap |
| **Editor** | `gemma4:12b-mlx` | The only model that produced a genuinely working fix, 25/25 |

> This plays to each one's strength: `gpt-oss` diagnoses but will not verify, and `gemma4:12b`
> verifies. Peak resident size 13 GB.
>
> **Lighter variant:** architect `qwen3.5:4b` at 3.4 GB with editor `gemma4:12b-mlx`. Peak 7.7
> GB, and barely slower.

### A full report on a subject

| Role | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | `qwen3.5:4b` | Perfect 25/25 search, 3.4 GB, zero swap, the fastest researcher |
| **Editor** | `gpt-oss:20b` | Perfect 25/25 report, 3/3 prose, 0 timeouts |

> A cheap, fast research phase, then the strongest writer for the document itself.
>
> **All-in-one alternative:** `gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic` scored 25 on search and 23.9 on
> the report by itself, but timed out 3 times out of 4.

### Strategic and long-horizon missions

| Role | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | `Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF` | 25/25 reasoning, only 5.6 GB, zero swap |
| **Editor** | `gemma4:12b-mlx` | The best overall executor, and 25/25 reasoning as well |

> Both are perfect on reasoning and both are small, so switching between them is quick. Avoid
> the 17 GB models here: they also scored 25/25 on reasoning, but cost 8 to 13 GB of swap to
> do it.

### Everyday quick questions, single model, no architect

**`qwen3.5:4b`.** 3.4 GB, zero swap, a perfect search score, and about 70/100 overall. The best
speed-to-quality ratio in the set.

### Uncensored work

**`gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic`.** 25/25 search, 23.9 report, second-best agentic, 7.4 GB,
no swap. Ignore `Agen/gemma-4-26B-heretic`: the same uncensored capability, but 17 GB, 8.7 GB
of swap, and it never finished the report.

## 6. Recommended Settings

```
Default model        gemma4:12b-mlx        (was ornith:9b, which timed out on 3 of 4 tasks)
Architect model      gpt-oss:20b
Editor model         gemma4:12b-mlx
Embedding model      bge-m3                (keep, it is required for RAG)

Temperature          0.35
Top P                0.95
Repeat penalty       1.15                  DO NOT LOWER, see below
Max output tokens    4096
Context size         32768                 (from 65536; the measured prompt is ~8,200 tokens)
Max tool rounds      45                    (from 25, which truncated a model mid-task)
```

> ### The one finding that changes everything
>
> **`repeat_penalty` at 1.10 breaks tool calling.** Holding every other setting fixed,
> **1.15 gave 9 successes out of 9, and 1.10 gave 2 out of 11.** The failures were malformed
> tool calls: either XML syntax errors, or JSON printed as prose.
>
> Temperature, top_p, seed and context size were each isolated and **ruled out**. Tool-call
> syntax is highly repetitive, being full of braces, quotes and repeated keys, so too weak a
> penalty lets the sampler fall into a loop mid-JSON.
>
> This defect first appeared disguised as "these four models cannot call tools", which is how
> much it matters. The Ollamancer code default was 1.1 and has been fixed.

## 7. Deleted, 89 GB Reclaimed

| Model | Size | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `charaf/Qwen3.6-27B-OBLITERATED-mlx-q8` | 28.6 GB | Ollama refuses to load it: *"requires 26.6 GiB, only 17.3 GiB available"* |
| `rafw007/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` | 23.9 GB | Loaded, being a MoE, but timed out with 3.6 GB of swap and empty output |
| `qwen3-coder:30b` | 18.6 GB | 180 s and 4.8 GB of swap to answer "what is the date" |
| `studiobrn/modCoderMLX` | 7.4 GB | Outputs `**` and nothing else, across 4 attempts |
| `MHKetbi/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B` | 5.3 GB | Zero tool calls, then invents answers such as "2023-10-16" and "15 files" |
| `htunnthuthutech/gemma-4-e2b-aiops` | 3.4 GB | Prints `<tool_calls>` as literal text |
| `oamazonasgabriel/qwen2.5-coder.1.5b` | 3.1 GB | Prints tool calls inside a json code fence |

**Kept:** `bge-m3`, the RAG embedder rather than a chat model, and `translategemma:27b`, which
has no tool support and is therefore out of this ranking, but which works for translation.

**Also removed, 11 August:** `gamy316/aileen1.0`, `lfm2.5:8b` and `ornith:9b`. All three scored
in the bottom five under `pass^2` (21.3, 9.0 and 39.3). They were temporarily re-pulled that day
purely to give them a second rep, then deleted again — their run directories and scores remain,
so they stay in the ranking without occupying 15.7 GB.

---

## 8. How Much to Trust This

- **One run per model per task.** Enough to separate 95 from 26. **Not** enough to separate
  4th from 5th. Treat gaps under about 6 points as ties.
  **Superseded on 11 August:** this caution turned out to be understated. A second rep moved
  eight of ten models, the largest by 17 points — more than the 6-point tie band suggested was
  possible. See [section 10](#10-pass2-the-ranking-as-published-on-11-august--superseded).
- **The 5-minute cap shapes the results.** **14** of 40 runs hit it. A model scoring 0 on the
  report might well have finished given 15 minutes, but that is not a workflow anyone wants.
  *(Corrected 2026-08-15: this said 19, which contradicted §1's own per-model timeout column on
  the same page — that column reads 0+0+0+1+1+2+2+2+3+3 and sums to 14. Recomputed from
  `scores.json`: 14 of the 40 rep-1 runs reached the 300 s cap. No threshold reproduces 19
  (≥250 s gives 18, ≥298 s gives 14), so 19 appears to have been a miscount rather than a
  different definition. §1 was right.)*
  **And "hit the cap" understates what happens**, which is the more important correction: a
  capped run does not merely score badly, it returns the six characters `ERROR:` and is recorded
  as `status: "ok"`. See the warning under [`PLAN.md` §3](./PLAN.md).
- **This benchmark was wrong twice before it was right.** A `repeat_penalty` of 1.1
  manufactured four false "this model cannot call tools" verdicts. A parsing bug scored a
  *perfect* reasoning answer 2.2 out of 25. A third bug read grounding evidence from only the
  final tool round, which made a model that had cited five real URLs look like it had
  fabricated all five. All three were caught by checking raw output against the score rather
  than trusting the number. Everything above is post-fix.
- **The search and report tasks hit the live web,** so difficulty varies a little between runs.
  Citations are therefore scored on *grounding*, meaning whether a URL appears in real
  retrieved content, rather than on truth.
- **Per-run scores ship; raw run directories do not.** `results/scores.json` is committed and
  holds every sub-score, timing and tool-call count behind the tables above. The run
  directories beside it, with each model's answers and tool traces, are deliberately
  gitignored: they contain the full text of third-party news articles fetched during the
  search and report tasks, which is not ours to republish. Re-running the harness locally
  regenerates them.

---

## 9. Additions, 10 August 2026

Same harness, same pinned parameters, same 5-minute cap. Three models added; the ten above
were not re-run, so their numbers are unchanged.

| # | Model | Size | Reasoning | Search | Agentic | Report | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **gemma4:12b-mlx** | 7.7 GB | 25 | 20.7 | **25** | 24.5 | **95.2** |
| 2 | **gpt-oss:20b** | 13 GB | 19 | 19 | 12 | **25** | **75.0** |
| 2= | **gemma4:e4b-mlx** | **8.8 GB** | 21 | 20 | 12 | 22 | **75.0** |
| 4 | Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | 5.6 GB | 25 | 17 | 6 | 22.8 | 70.8 |
| 5 | qwen3.5:4b | 3.4 GB | 12 | **25** | 9 | 23.9 | 69.9 |
| 6 | gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic | 7.4 GB | 0 | **25** | 15 | 23.9 | 63.9 |
| 7 | Agen/gemma-4-26B-heretic | 17 GB | 25 | **25** | 9 | 0 | 59.0 |
| 8 | gemma4:26b-mlx | 17 GB | 25 | 22 | 9 | 0 | 56.0 |
| 9 | qwen2.5:7b | 4.7 GB | 9 | 18.7 | 6 | 20.2 | 53.9 |
| 10 | ornith:9b | 5.6 GB | 0 | 19 | 6 | **25** | 50.0 |
| 11 | gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16 | 16 GB | 15 | **25** | 6 | 0 | 46.0 |
| 12 | gamy316/aileen1.0 | 4.9 GB | 13.8 | 14.3 | 6 | 0 | 34.1 |
| 13 | lfm2.5:8b | 5.2 GB | 0 | 17 | 9 | 0 | 26.0 |

`gemma4:e4b-mlx` enters joint 2nd at **8.8 GB**, matching a 13 GB model. `qwen2.5:7b` lands
mid-table with no niche of its own, though at 397 s it is the fastest model scoring above 34.

### 9.1 Full precision lost to 4-bit, by 29 points

The two `e4b` entries are the same Google model, same architecture, same MLX engine, differing
only in quantisation. That makes them the one controlled pair in this campaign.

| Task | `e4b-mlx` (8.8 GB, nvfp4) | `e4b-mlx-bf16` (16 GB, unquantised) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reasoning | 21.0 (50 s) | 15.0 (56 s) | **+6.0** |
| Search | 20.0 (56 s) | **25.0** (149 s) | -5.0 |
| Agentic | 12.0 (300 s) | 6.0 (300 s) | **+6.0** |
| Report | 22.0 (300 s) | **0.0** (293 s) | **+22.0** |
| **Total** | **75.0** | **46.0** | **+29.0** |

The extra 7.2 GB bought no measurable quality. It bought swap. The bf16 build was **2.7x
slower on the search task** for an identical result, touched swap on both runs where it was
sampled (+1342 MB, +1066 MB), and on the report task spent 293 seconds to produce a single
tool call and no file at all.

> **The lesson is not "quantisation is free."** It is that on 24 GB of unified memory, memory
> headroom dominates precision. A 4-bit build that fits beats a full-precision build that
> swaps, and it is not close. Spend the budget on headroom first.

### 9.2 A reproducible blind spot in `gemma4:e4b-mlx`

The one task bf16 won was search, and the whole 5-point gap is a single sub-score:

```
e4b-mlx        datetime_first 0 · deep_read 4 · story_count 5 · diversity 4 · grounded 7.0
e4b-mlx-bf16   datetime_first 5 · deep_read 4 · story_count 5 · diversity 4 · grounded 7.0
```

Every other signal is identical. The quantised build never calls `get_datetime` before
searching. That looked like a coin flip, so the search task was re-run at four different
seeds: **0 out of 4**. It is a stable trait, not sampling noise.

The system prompt is explicit about this (`agentic/i18n.py`, "Never guess today's date ...
call `get_datetime` first"), so this is an instruction-following failure rather than a gap in
the agent.

**It already produces wrong answers, quietly.** Instead of resolving the date, the model puts
the relative phrase straight into the query -- `search_web_deep("geopolitics breaking news
last 24 hours")` -- and lets the search engine handle recency. In the run inspected on
2026-08-10, two of its three stories fell outside the requested window, including one about
events "last month". Story count, diversity and grounding all scored full marks, because none
of them checks recency. `datetime_first` is the only signal that catches it.

Grounding itself was flawless: **7.0/7.0 across all four reruns, zero fabricated URLs.**

> **Practical guidance.** For date-bounded questions, either use `qwen3.5:4b` (25/25 on
> search, 3.4 GB) or tell `gemma4:e4b-mlx` to check the date explicitly, which it then does.

## 10. `pass^2`: the ranking as published on 11 August — SUPERSEDED

> ⚠️ **Do not quote this section.** Every number in it was produced by a scorer that counted a timed-out run as a completed one. See [§11](#11-the-corrected-ranking-15-august-2026--read-this-instead-of-10). Kept unedited as the record of what was published.

Five models were added and, more importantly, **every model in the ranking was given a second
rep**. The reported score is now the **minimum across reps** (`pass^k`, PLAN.md §1.3): a model
scores only what it can produce *every* time. Same harness, same pinned parameters, same cap.

| # | Model | Size | Reas. | Search | Agentic | Report | **pass^2** | mean | was pass^1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **qwen-heretic** ⁴ (Qwen3.5-9B) | 7.0 GB | 17.0 | 20.0 | **25** | **25** | **87.0** | 91.3 | *new* |

| 4 | **gpt-oss:20b** | 13 GB | 19.0 | 19.0 | 12 | **25** | **75.0** | 80.0 | 75.0 (=) |
| 5 | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B **IQ2_M** | 12.6 GB | 17.0 | 17.0 | 12 | 23.8 | 69.8 | 74.7 | *new* |

| 11 | Agen/gemma-4-26B-heretic | 17 GB | **25** | 22.0 | 9 | 0 | 56.0 | 68.5 | 59.0 (−3.0) |

| 18 | lfm2.5:8b | 5.2 GB | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 9.0 | 17.5 | 26.0 (−17.0) |

**Every total above is final.** All 26 outstanding hand judgements were completed on 11 August,
so no row is provisional and `score.py --all` reports an empty worklist.

² **Not `pass^2`** — never in the rep-2 scope. `qwen2.5:7b` and `gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16` are single
observations throughout. `gemma4:e4b-mlx` is single-run on reasoning, agentic and report, but
has **four** reps on search from the §9.2 seed investigation, so its rep count is inconsistent
even within its own row. None of the three is comparable to the rest of the table; the scorer
marks them `◆`. **Rank 2 is therefore not a real second place** — it is a single run sitting in
a table of minimums.
³ These three rose (+4.7, +4.0, +3.0) purely because their hand judgements were completed, not
because they were re-run. Judging can only raise a score; reps can only lower it.
⁴ **`qwen-heretic:latest` is a local tag, not a pullable name.** The underlying build is
`Qwen3.5-9B-The-Defiant-Fable-Uncnr-Heretic-NEO-MAX-Q4_K_M.gguf`, imported into Ollama from a
local file: `ollama show --modelfile` resolves only to a blob hash, with no upstream repository
recorded. Everything else in this table can be pulled by the name given; **the top-ranked model
cannot**, so this row is the one result here that a reader cannot independently reproduce
without sourcing that GGUF themselves. `ollama show` confirms what it is — architecture
`qwen35`, 9.2B parameters, Q4_K_M, 262144 context — but not where it came from.

### 10.1 A second rep costs almost everyone points

Of the ten models re-run, **eight scored lower and two held exactly**:

| Held | Dropped a little | Dropped hard |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-oss:20b` (=) | `qwen3.5:4b` −3.0 | `lfm2.5:8b` **−17.0** |
| `gemma4:26b-mlx` (=) | `Agen/gemma-4-26B` −3.0 | `gemma4:12b-mlx` **−16.0** |
| | `Ornith-1.0-9B` −4.8 | `gamy316/aileen1.0` **−12.8** |
| | `nightshift-heretic` −6.6 | `ornith:9b` **−10.7** |

The pass^1 table was flattering nearly everyone. `gpt-oss:20b` holding its 75.0 exactly across
both reps is, in this light, a stronger result than its rank suggests: **it is the most
repeatable model in the set**, with 0 timeouts and 0 swap across all 8 runs.

### 10.2 The top of the table changed, and why

`gemma4:12b-mlx` lost first place on **one task**:

```
gemma4:12b-mlx   agentic   [25, 9]    spread 16   ← passed the playthrough once, not twice
qwen-heretic     agentic   [25, 25]   spread  0   ← passed it both times
```

`gemma4:12b-mlx` remains the better model on a good day — its mean of 89.3 is second only to
`qwen-heretic`'s 91.3. It is not the more *dependable* one. That is the entire content of
`pass^k`, and it is why the metric exists.

> **The ordering was checked before it was trusted.** When the judged items were still
> outstanding the gap was only 2.8 points, smaller than the 7 points each model could still
> gain, so the result was published as provisional and the default was left alone. Completing
> the judgements *widened* the gap to 7.8: `qwen-heretic` gained 5.0 (a perfect 25/25 report on
> both reps) while `gemma4:12b-mlx`, already fully judged, could not move.
>
> **The default model has still not been changed.** One campaign on one machine is not grounds
> to re-point the documentation, and `gemma4:12b-mlx` is stronger on reasoning (25 vs 17).
>
> **And the comparison is confounded.** `gemma4:12b-mlx`'s two reps ran on *different builds of
> the harness* (see §10.6): rep 1 on 8 August, rep 2 after eight commits including a new tool
> and a change to three generation defaults. Its `[25, 9]` may be model variance, harness
> change, or both. `qwen-heretic` ran both reps on one build, so its own score is sound — but
> **the gap between them is not a clean measurement**, and no default should move on it.

### 10.3 Three controlled quantisation pairs

> ⚠️ **The figures below are the superseded ones.** The finding survives the correction; the
> numbers do not. On the corrected core /75 of §11 the three pairs read
> **37.0 vs 0.0**,
> **34.0 vs 18.0**, and
> **57.8 vs 38.0** — same direction in all three, and
> the 9B pair is still the widest gap in the campaign. Quote §11's numbers, not these.

| Pair | Lower / smaller | Higher / larger | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.5-**9B** | `qwen-heretic` Q4_K_M, 7.0 GB → **87.0** | `qwen3.5:9b-mlx` nvfp4, 8.9 GB → **10.0** | 8.7× gap, same base weights |
| Qwen3.5-**4B** | `qwen3.5:4b` Q4, 3.4 GB → **66.9** | `qwen3.5:4b-mlx` nvfp4, 4.0 GB → **28.0** | same direction |
| Qwen3.6-**35B-A3B** | `IQ2_M`, 12.6 GB → **69.8** | `IQ3_M`, 16.3 GB → **69.0** | +3.7 GB buys nothing |

The 9B pair is the cleanest controlled result in this campaign: **identical base model,
differing only in quantisation and runtime, and an 87.0 against a 10.0.** Neither nvfp4 build
touched swap, so this is not the memory story of §9.1. `qwen3.5:9b-mlx` timed out on **6 of 8
runs** — it simply does not finish. `qwen3.5:4b-mlx` timed out only 2 of 8 and still scored
28.0, so its weakness is genuine, not just slowness.

Both nvfp4 builds declare `requires 0.19.0`. **Treat this as a suspected runtime problem, not
a verdict on the weights** — it has not been isolated the way `repeat_penalty` was in §6.

The 35B pair repeats §9.1's lesson with the sign flipped, and it is the sharpest illustration
of `pass^k` in the file: **IQ3_M has the higher mean (76.5 vs 74.7) but the lower pass^2 (69.0
vs 69.8).** The larger quantisation is better on a good run and less dependable across runs —
its reasoning spread is 9.0 against IQ2_M's 1.0. It also touched swap where IQ2_M never did.
On any best-of or average-of metric IQ3_M wins and you buy the extra 3.7 GB; on the metric that
asks what you get *every* time, it loses.

### 10.4 Size still does not buy quality, but memory headroom explains most of it

| Model | Timeouts | Swap caused | pass^2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma4:26b-mlx` | 4/8 | **+18.9 GB** | 56.0 |
| `Agen/gemma-4-26B` | 4/8 | **+16.2 GB** | 56.0 |
| `gemma4:12b-mlx` | 3/8 | +7.9 GB | 79.2 |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B IQ2_M | **2/8** | **0 MB** | 69.8 |
| `qwen-heretic` | 4/8 | **0 MB** | 87.0 |

The two 26B models **beat every other model on pure reasoning** (25.0, a perfect score, against
`qwen-heretic`'s 15.0) and still finish 26 points behind, because they page 16–19 GB and never
complete the report task. Per PLAN.md §7, that is evidence about **this machine**, not about
those models.

The 35B A3B pair is the control that proves the point: as a mixture-of-experts activating ~3B
parameters per token, it **fits** — zero swap, and it timed out *less* than the winner did
(2 of 8 against 4 of 8) — and it still loses to `qwen-heretic` by 17.2 points. The gap there is
entirely agentic (12 and 6 against 25), not memory.

(Fewest timeouts overall belongs to `gpt-oss:20b`, `gamy316/aileen1.0` and `lfm2.5:8b`, all at
**0 of 8** — though for the latter two that reflects giving up quickly rather than working fast.)

> **The honest one-line summary.** On 24 GB, `qwen-heretic` is the best *agentic* model tested
> and the best all-rounder that never swaps. It does **not** out-reason the 26B models, which
> beat it 25 to 17 on the one task that isolates reasoning — they just cannot finish a job on
> this hardware.

### 10.5 What changed in the harness

- `score.py` now implements `pass^k`. It was previously documented in PLAN.md but not coded:
  N reps produced N unlinked rows and nothing compared them. It now emits a `(model, task)`
  roll-up (`pass_k_total`, `mean_total`, `spread`, `status_all_ok`) and a ranked per-model
  roll-up, to `results/scores_rollup.json` alongside the unchanged per-run `results/scores.json`.
- Rows whose rep count differs from the rest of the table are marked `◆` and excluded from
  comparison by the printed legend.
- `judged.json` accepts a per-rep key (`<model>#rep<n>`). It was keyed by model alone, so
  rep 2 silently inherited rep 1's hand score for the two judged items — the two items that
  could therefore never vary across reps, defeating the point of running them. Legacy
  model-only keys still resolve and are flagged as inherited in the run notes.
- A total with an unjudged item is reported `PROVISIONAL`, and `--all` prints a worklist of
  every `(task, item, model, rep)` still owed, so the debt cannot be quietly forgotten.
- `rank.sh` now defaults to `--reps 2`.

### 10.6 Additional limits, on top of section 8

- **Two reps is the floor for a `pass^k` claim, not a comfortable margin.** τ-bench uses more.
  Two reps catch a model that fails half the time; they do not catch one that fails 1 in 5.
- **The hand judgements are complete.** All 26 were scored on 11 August against the existing
  2026-08-08 judgements as calibration (rubric recorded in `judged.json` under
  `_schema.judged_2026_08_11`), so no total is a floor. They remain a *judgement*: two items,
  7 of the 100 points, rest on a human reading rather than on a deterministic check.
- **Three models are not `pass^2`** (`gemma4:e4b-mlx`, `qwen2.5:7b`, `gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16`) and
  are marked `◆` by the scorer. Do not compare them across the line.
- **The 5-minute cap binds harder than in section 8.** 48 of 135 scored runs hit it, 36%. For
  the slowest models the ranking is measuring what fits in five minutes, which is the intended
  question but is not the same as model quality.
- **The two reps of the ten older models did not run on the same harness, and this is the
  most serious limitation on this page.** PLAN.md §1.2 makes "hold the harness constant so
  failures attribute to the model" a design principle, and for those ten it was not held:

  The ten older survivors ran **rep 1 on 8 August (14:52–17:14)** and **rep 2 on 10–11 August**.
  The five models added on 11 August ran **both reps on 11 August**, on one build.

  Eight commits landed on `agentic/` in between, including a **new tool** (`repo_map`, so the
  tool schema in every prompt grew), a change to **three generation defaults** described at the
  time as "quietly costing tool-call reliability", and two bug fixes. The effect is measurable
  rather than hypothetical: on `t1`, the zero-tool task where the prompt is just system +
  schema + question, **every** model whose rep 1 ran on 8 August shows a rep-2 prompt **195 to
  356 tokens larger**, while models with both reps on 11 August show a delta of 0.

  So for those ten, a rep-1-to-rep-2 difference is *model variance plus harness change*, and the
  two cannot be separated after the fact. **This directly touches the headline result:**
  `gemma4:12b-mlx` lost first place on a single task going `[25, 9]`, and those two runs were
  on different harnesses. The five models added on 11 August are unaffected — both of their
  reps ran on one build — so `qwen-heretic`'s 87.0 is clean, but the comparison *against*
  `gemma4:12b-mlx` inherits the problem.

  **This will not be fixed.** The remedy is to re-run rep 1 for those ten on the current build:
  40 runs, ~2.1 h of model time, ~3 h in practice once the memory interruptions and the re-pull
  of three since-deleted models are counted. That was judged not worth the machine time, so it
  is recorded here as a known limitation rather than a pending task. **Treat the ordering of
  ranks 1–3 as unresolved rather than as measured**, and do not quote the gap between
  `qwen-heretic` and `gemma4:12b-mlx` as a clean result.
- **The campaign was interrupted four times by memory exhaustion.** `gemma4:12b-mlx` on the
  report task spikes **+1.58 GB of swap** and repeatedly killed the driver process; the runs
  were completed after unloading resident models between attempts. No run in the table was
  produced under those degraded conditions — `rank.sh` re-runs anything without a `meta.json`.

---

## 11. The corrected ranking (15 August 2026) — read this instead of §10

> **The Search column is superseded by §12.** The web layer changed on 16 August and T2
> was re-run; every other column here still stands. Sections are never edited in place
> in this file, so the old numbers remain below as published.

**§10 was wrong, and by a lot.** A timed-out run recorded `status: "ok"` and was scored on
whatever artifact it had left behind, so runs that produced nothing collected up to 25/25.
Fixing that moved 42 of 135 runs, took the number scoring zero from 17 to 59, and cost fifteen
of eighteen models points. `qwen-heretic`, §10's first place at 87.0 and described there as
"best agentic *and* best report score tested, both perfect on both reps", **timed out on all
four of its T3 and T4 runs** at the 300 s cap; both of its 25/25s came from files left behind by
turns that never finished. The mechanism, the scale and the fix are in
[`PLAN.md` §3](./PLAN.md).

§10 is kept unedited, like §1–§9 before it, because the gap between a published ranking and its
correction is the most useful thing in this file. **Nothing in §1–§10 should be quoted.**

### 11.1 Why this section does not lead with a score out of 100

The same fix that corrected the numbers also made a single total indefensible, and it was
already weak before. Across all 18 models:

| Task | Best `pass^k` | Median | Runs that produced no answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 reasoning | 25/25 | 16.5 | 5/33 |
| T2 web search | 25/25 | 18.9 | 3/36 |
| **T3 agentic** | **12/25** | **0** | **22/33** |
| T4 report | 23.8/25 | 0 | 20/33 |

**Fourteen of eighteen models score zero on T3, and the best result in the entire campaign is
12 out of 25.** That is not a scoring artifact: `DESIGN.md` §6 already calls end-to-end
multi-bug fixing *the open problem*, and no model has ever solved this fixture in one sitting.

Averaging a task almost nobody passes into three that most models partly pass produces a number
that describes neither. A top score of 57.8/100 reads like a mediocre grade; what it actually
means is 17/25 reasoning, 17/25 search, 23.8/25 report, and a wall on a research problem. So
the headline below is the **core 75** — reasoning, search, report — with agentic reported beside
it as the open challenge it is, and completion rate shown so a low score is never confused with
a slow one.

T3 stays in the battery. It is the only task that separates `gpt-oss:20b` and `qwen2.5:7b`
from everything else, and a discriminator that four models in eighteen can touch is worth more
than one everybody passes. It just should not be blended into a single figure.

### 11.2 Ranking

Same runs as §10, same protocol, corrected scorer. `pass^k` is the **minimum** across reps, so a
model counts only what it produced every time. **Runs completed** is how many of that model's
runs returned an answer at all rather than hitting the 300 s cap.

| # | Model | Size | Reasoning | Search | Report | **Core /75** | Agentic /25 | Runs completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B **IQ2_M** | 12.6 GB | 17 | 17 | 23.8 | **57.8** | 0 | 6/8 |
| 2 | qwen2.5:7b ◆ | 4.7 GB | 12 | 19 | 21.2 | **51.9** | 6 | 4/4 |

| 7 | gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16 ◆ | 16 GB | 18 | 25 | 0.0 | **43.0** | 0 | 3/4 |
| 8 | Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF | 5.6 GB | 25 | 16 | 0.0 | **41.0** | 0 | 4/8 |
| 9 | gpt-oss:20b | 13 GB | 19 | 19 | 0.0 | **38.0** | 12 | 7/8 |
| 10 | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B **IQ3_M** | 16.3 GB | 16 | 22 | 0.0 | **38.0** | 0 | 4/8 |

| 15 | gamy316/aileen1.0 | 4.9 GB | 1 | 14 | 0.0 | **15.3** | 6 | 8/8 |
| 16 | ornith:9b | 5.6 GB | 0 | 14 | 0.0 | **14.3** | 0 | 3/8 |
| 17 | lfm2.5:8b | 5.2 GB | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | **0.0** | 9 | 8/8 |
| 18 | qwen3.5:9b-mlx | 8.9 GB | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | **0.0** | 0 | 2/8 |

◆ **Not `pass^2`** — single-observation rows, not comparable to the rest. `qwen2.5:7b` and
`gemma4:e4b-mlx-bf16` were never in the rep-2 scope; `gemma4:e4b-mlx` has four reps on search
and one elsewhere, so its rep count is inconsistent even within its own row.

### 11.3 What actually changed, and what to take from it

- **The 300 s cap decides more than the models do.** 50 of 135 runs produced nothing, and T3 and
  T4 account for 42 of those. Any reading of this table is a reading of behaviour under a
  five-minute budget on a 24 GB laptop, not of the models in general.
- **Completion rate is the column to read first.** `gamy316/aileen1.0` and `lfm2.5:8b` completed
  8/8 runs and still rank near the bottom: they are not slow, they are weak. `Agen/gemma-4-26B`
  ranks third on 4/8 — strong when it finishes, and it finishes half the time. Those are
  different recommendations and one number cannot carry both.
- **`gpt-oss:20b` is the most interesting row.** It ranks ninth on core and scores **12/25 on
  T3, the highest result any model has recorded on the agentic task**, with 7/8 runs completed.
  On the old blended total it sat third for the wrong reason; here it is visible for the right
  one.
- **`lfm2.5:8b` scores 0 on all three core tasks and 9 on T3.** Every point it has comes from
  the hardest task in the battery. On 8/8 completed runs that is not noise, and it is not a
  result a single total would ever have surfaced.
- **The ranking is not settled at the top.** Ranks 1–8 span 57.8 to 41.0 with three
  non-comparable single-run rows inside them, and §10.4's caveat still applies: several rep-1
  runs predate scorer fixes their rep-2 counterparts benefited from. **Treat the top half as
  unordered.**

### 11.4 What would make this better, stated rather than done

- **Study the cap instead of fixing it.** Every table here is at 300 s. Running the same battery
  at 300/600/900 would separate "cannot do this" from "cannot do this quickly", which is the
  single largest confound in the file.
- **Re-measure with the current agent.** These runs predate deadline salvage: a turn that ran
  out returned nothing, where the shipped agent now answers from what it gathered. The benchmark
  measures an agent that no longer exists, and a re-run would have to cover all 135 runs, since
  mixing salvaged and non-salvaged runs in one table is exactly the comparability failure
  §1.2 exists to prevent.
- **Re-run rep 1 for the original ten** on the current build, closing §10.4's inherited defect.

## 12. T2 re-run after the web layer changed (16 August 2026)

The agent's web path changed on 16 August: a `web-answer-format` skill loaded code-side on
web-shaped questions, `search_web_deep(query, sections=[...])` returning breadth from results it
already had, and freshness filtering for news. §11's Search column was produced before all of
that, so it describes code that no longer ships. **T1, T3 and T4 were not re-run** — the
auto-load trigger fires on none of those task prompts, verified against the prompt files, though
verified by pattern rather than by running them.

Twelve of the fifteen models in `survivors.txt`: three were uninstalled from the machine and are
recorded as such rather than dropped. Same protocol, same pinned parameters, same 300 s cap;
`MAX_SECTIONS` and `SECTION_RSS_ITEMS` are now pinned in `run_one.py` too, so a later change to
a shipped default cannot silently make old and new runs incomparable.

| **mean** | **17.1** | **157s** | **22.9** | **148s** | **+5.8** |

`pass^k`, the minimum across two reps, out of 25. **Mean 17.1 → 22.9 (63% → 92%), mean time
157 s → 148 s, and no run hit the cap in either direction.** Both models that scored zero now
pass; `qwen3.5:9b-mlx` had timed out on both reps.

### 12.1 The first re-run was a regression, and that is the useful part

Run on the code as first written, T2 produced **three timeouts where thirty-six banked runs had
none**, and a model that had scored 25/25 twice returned an empty response. The cause was not
the search: it was the skill file, at 1,594 tokens, plus a rule telling the model to write
`Sections: A, B, C` as prose *before* calling a tool — models that treat content and tool_calls
as exclusive answered with neither and burned a generation on the retry.

Three fixes, each measured:

- **The question's own count wins.** The task asks for three stories; the skill asked for 3–6
  items per section across 2–4 sections, so models wrote up to twenty-four. That was the doubled
  generation time, not the extra sources.
- **A leaner skill is not automatically better.** At 555 tokens, with a shape example showing
  *one* section and *one* bullet, `gemma4:12b-mlx` produced exactly one item and scored 19.0 —
  **worse than no skill at all** (20.7). A small model copies the example, not the instruction.
  Showing three sections of two items cost forty tokens and took the same model to 25/25 in
  59 s, against 118 s before the feature existed.
- **A sixth Ollama tool-call signature.** `gpt-oss:20b` emitted
  `{"query":"...",sections:["science"]}` with the second key unquoted; Ollama rejects the call
  with a 500 and the turn dies with `ERROR:` as its answer, scoring 0 on a task it had passed at
  19/25. It appeared because the tool gained a second parameter — a two-key object is harder for
  a small model to serialise than a one-key object — so any tool that grows an argument can wake
  it. With the retry-and-failover ladder the other five signatures already had, that run scores
  25/25.

### 12.2 Limits

- **Two models slipped**: `gemma4:26b-mlx` by 3.0 and `gemma-4-12b-nightshift-heretic` by 1.3.
  At two reps that is inside the spread this campaign has shown elsewhere, so the honest reading
  is *no evidence of improvement for those two*, not a demonstrated cost.
- **The gain is in consistency, not in peak quality.** Best-rep scores barely move; several
  models already reached 25. What changed is the weak rep, which is exactly what `pass^k`
  measures and exactly what a user feels.
- Sixteen models were in the original campaign, twelve here. The three uninstalled ones and the
  single-observation rows marked ◆ in §11 are not comparable across the two sections.
- One task, one machine, one SearXNG instance whose news index returned nothing dated inside
  thirty days for the benchmark query — which is why the freshness filter matters here and might
  matter less elsewhere.

### 12.3 The cap measures the machine as much as the model — demonstrated

T1 was re-run the same day, purely to confirm that the auto-load trigger stays out of a task
whose prompt says "do NOT use any tool, do not search the web". It does: **no `LOAD_SKILL` and
no skill text in any of the 24 runs, and 23 of 24 made zero tool calls** — the exception called
`python_repl`, a model disobeying the instruction on its own.

The scores, however, appeared to collapse: `pass^k` 15.1 → 9.8, with four models dropping to
zero. Every one of those was a **rep-1 timeout whose rep-2 completed comfortably** (289 s, 140 s,
110 s, 83 s, 118 s). Rep 1 is each model's cold load, and by then the machine had spent a day
benchmarking, with swap at 7 GB of 8 GB.

So the same model, task and seed was run once more with the machine idle — 85% memory free, swap
at 3.5 GB. `gemma4:12b-mlx` T1 rep 1, which had just timed out at 300 s, scored **25/25 in
180 s**. Same code, same run, opposite result.

That is §11.3's first bullet, reproduced deliberately rather than inferred: **a zero in this file
can mean "the machine was paging", not "the model cannot do this".** The contaminated runs are
kept under `archive/t1_check_20260816_contaminated/` and the published T1 set was restored
untouched, verified score-identical. It is also the strongest argument for §11.4's first item —
running the battery at 300/600/900 s would separate the two readings instead of leaving them
fused, and until that is done, **every zero in this file carries this ambiguity.**
