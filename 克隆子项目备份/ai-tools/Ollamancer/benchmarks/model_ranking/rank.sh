#   bash rank.sh battery --reps 2        # add a second rep (doubles the time)

#
# Three invariants this script enforces rather than trusts:
#   1. Exactly one model is resident at a time (`ollama ps` is asserted empty before
#      every run and the model is stopped after it).
#   2. Swap usage is sampled either side of every run. The two >20 GB models are on
#      this machine's edge (24 GB unified memory) but their vendors advertise a real
#      working set below the on-disk size, the A3B one is a mixture-of-experts that
#      activates ~3B parameters per token. So they are TESTED by default, and whether
#      they actually fit is answered by the measured swap delta and by whether they
#      crash. --skip-heavy leaves them out.
#   3. The real ~/.agentic_1a_* files are byte-identical at the end. If they are not,
#      the campaign aborts loudly, a benchmark must never mutate the user's setup.
