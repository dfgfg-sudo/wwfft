"""Run ONE task against ONE model, in full isolation, and record everything.

This is the only place the ranking campaign talks to the agent. It deliberately does
not shell out to `agent.py`: it imports the package and patches `config` *before*
`cli.main()` reads anything, which is what lets it

  * pin every generation parameter identically for all models (see PLAN.md §3), and
  * guarantee the run cannot touch the user's real `~/.agentic_1a_*` files —
    every config path is redirected into the run directory first.

That second point is not paranoia. A test once wrote the real params file and left
every setting one step off, which silently broke the user's models until it was
traced back. Redirecting the paths makes that failure mode unreachable rather than
merely unlikely.

Usage (normally driven by rank.sh, not by hand):

    python3 run_one.py --model qwen3.5:4b --task t1 --outdir results/qwen3.5_4b/t1_rep1

    `agentic/cli.py` wraps `run_agent` in a bare `except Exception` so that one bad turn cannot
    kill an interactive session. That guard is correct for its purpose and swallowed this
    timeout whole: the SIGALRM handler raised, the agent caught it, printed its generic
    "Unexpected error:" (with an empty message, since this class carries none), and returned
    normally. The harness then recorded `status: "ok"` on a run that had produced nothing.

    50 of the 135 scored runs in the banked campaign are blank for exactly this reason, and
    score.py scored them as completed — up to 25/25, because T3 and T4 grade the artifact left
    behind rather than the answer.

    `BaseException` is how Python already spells "control flow that a catch-all must not
    intercept", which is why KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit live there. A benchmark deadline
    is the same kind of thing: it is the harness stopping the run, not the run failing.
