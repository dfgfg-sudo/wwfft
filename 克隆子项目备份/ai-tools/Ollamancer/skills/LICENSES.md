# Licensing of the bundled skills

Ollamancer as a whole is **MIT** licensed (see [`../LICENSE`](../LICENSE)).

Twelve of the fourteen bundled skills were written for this project and are covered by that
MIT license. **Two are adapted from third-party Apache-2.0 work and remain Apache-2.0.**

## Apache-2.0 (adapted from `anthropics/skills`)

| Skill | Upstream |
|---|---|
| [`skill-creator/`](./skill-creator/SKILL.md) | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), `skill-creator` |
| [`mcp-builder/`](./mcp-builder/SKILL.md) | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), `mcp-builder` |

Both were **modified** for this agent: rewritten to target Ollamancer's own tools, its
`~/.agentic_1a_skills/` and `<project>/.agentic/skills/` discovery paths, and its
`~/.agentic_1a_mcp.json` MCP configuration. Each file declares `license: Apache-2.0` in its
YAML frontmatter and credits the upstream project inline.

## Skills you add yourself

Skills you drop into `~/.agentic_1a_skills/` or `<project>/.agentic/skills/` are yours and
are not covered by either license, nothing in this repository claims them.
