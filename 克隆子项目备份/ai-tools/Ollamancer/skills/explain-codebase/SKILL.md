# Explain a codebase

Build an accurate mental map from the real code, not assumptions. Cite files as you go.

## Steps

1. **Survey the layout.** `list_directory` the root; read `README`, `pyproject.toml`/
   `package.json`/`go.mod`, and any docs. Note the language(s), framework, and how it's run.
2. **Find the entry points.** Look for `main`, `__main__`, `if __name__ == "__main__"`, CLI
   definitions, server `app`/`routes`, or `bin`/`cmd`, `search_in_files` for them.
3. **Map the key modules.** Identify the few files that carry the core logic (biggest, most
   imported). Use `search_semantic` for concept-based questions ("where is auth handled?") and
   `find_references` to see how a central function/class is used across the project.
4. **Trace one real flow end-to-end.** Pick the main use case and follow it from entry point
   through the modules that handle it, `read_file_lines` the relevant parts. This reveals the
   actual architecture better than reading everything.
5. **Summarize** for the user: a short "what it is", a component map (module → responsibility),
   the main flow you traced, and where to start for a typical change. Point to concrete files
   (`path:line`). Flag anything surprising or fragile you noticed.

## Notes

- Don't invent components you didn't actually see, if something is unclear, say so and point to
  where you'd look next.
- Keep it proportional: a tour, not a line-by-line dump.
