# Skill creator

Guide the user through writing a good, reusable `SKILL.md`. Adapted for this agent from
Anthropic's open `skill-creator` (anthropics/skills, Apache-2.0). The most important part of
a skill is the **description**, it's what makes the model pick the skill at the right time.

## Steps

1. **Capture the intent.** Ask (or infer) what repeatable task this skill should handle, and
   *when* it should trigger. One skill = one clear job. If the user's idea is broad, split it.

2. **Choose the name.** Lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens only, ≤ 64 characters, matching
   the task (e.g. `security-review`, `changelog-from-git`).

3. **Write a sharp description** (≤ 1024 chars). State *what it does* AND *when to use it*, in
   words a user would actually say. This drives routing, vague descriptions never trigger.
   - Good: "Audit the current diff for real security issues. Use when the user asks for a
     security review or to check code for vulnerabilities."
   - Bad: "Security stuff."

4. **Write the body** as concrete markdown, referencing THIS agent's real tools:
   - Reading/searching: `read_file`, `read_file_lines`, `search_in_files`, `find_references`,
     `search_semantic`, `list_directory`, `git_diff`/`git_status`/`git_log`.
   - Writing/running: `write_file`, `append_file` (for files > ~80 lines, write in chunks),
     `edit_file`, `run_command`, `python_repl`, `run_tests`, `lint_file`.
   - Structure it as: `## Overview` (one line), `## Steps` (numbered, concrete), `## Example`,
     and `## Notes` (gotchas). Keep the body focused (a few hundred lines max); put long
     reference material in separate files in the same folder and tell the model to `read_file`
     them only when needed (progressive disclosure).

5. **Save it.** Create the folder + file with `write_file`:
   - Global (all projects): `~/.agentic_1a_skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - This project only: `<project>/.agentic/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   Ask the user which scope they want.

6. **Verify.** Tell the user to run `/skills`, the new skill should appear with its
   description. If it doesn't, check that the frontmatter has both `name` and `description`
   between `---` lines.

## Example

For "make a skill that writes release notes from git history", you'd create
`~/.agentic_1a_skills/release-notes/SKILL.md` with a description like *"Generate release
notes from recent git commits. Use when the user asks for release notes or a changelog"*, and
a body that says: run `git_log`, group commits by type, write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with
`write_file`, never invent commits that aren't in the log.

## Notes

- Never write instructions that exfiltrate data or run destructive commands, a skill's text
  is followed by the agent, which can act on this machine.
- Keep one behavior per skill; compose several small skills rather than one giant one.
