"""Running out of budget must produce an answer, not a status line.

Both ways a turn can end without finishing used to discard everything it had gathered. The
round limit returned the string "Stopped after N tool-call rounds"; a wall-clock deadline had no
handling at all. In the model-ranking campaign the second case hit **50 of 135 runs** — one of
them after 35 successful tool calls whose results were read, useful, and thrown away. What the
user got for eight minutes of waiting was a sentence explaining there would be no answer.

`_salvage` spends one final generation instead: no tools, answer from the evidence already in
the conversation, say plainly what is missing. The literature's phrasing for this is exact —
the choice is between a useful 80% answer and a useless 0% one.

Three properties, all pinned below, and each one was a real bug or nearly one:

  1. **The salvage call carries NO tools.** `_stream_or_buffer_chat(model, messages, None)`
     means *every* native and MCP tool, not none — the first version of `_salvage` passed None
     and handed the model the full toolset at the exact moment the budget was gone. It failed
     silently, too: the model just made another tool call, the salvage returned empty, and the
     status line came back anyway. Only an explicit `[]` disables them.
  2. **The salvaged answer is what the caller receives**, not the exhaustion message.
  3. **Failure is still honest.** If the salvage generation itself fails or comes back empty,
     the status line returns. A salvage that silently produced nothing would be worse than the
     message it replaced.

The honesty layer still runs on the salvaged text (`_grounding_check`, warn-not-nudge, since a
nudge is another generation and the budget is gone). Forcing an answer out of partial evidence
is exactly the condition that produces fabrication, so it is the last place to stop checking.

Offline: `ollama.chat` is monkeypatched with a model that calls tools while it has them and
answers when it does not — which is the behaviour the whole mechanism depends on.
