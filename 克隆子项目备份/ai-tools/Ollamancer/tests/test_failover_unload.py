"""A plumbing failover must unload the model it is failing away from.

`models.py` states the invariant: two resident models do not fit in 24 GB. `cmd_architect`
and `cmd_review_by` honour it at four call sites. The three failover branches did not — each
did a bare `model = target` — and the omission survived precisely because it was written three
times instead of once.

It was also unreachable by default: `PLUMBING_FAILOVER_MODEL` ships as `""`, so
`_plumbing_failover_target()` returns nothing and the branch never executes. The first real
failover after a backup model was configured stalled a turn for ten minutes, paging two
co-resident models (13.2 GB + 4.2 GB) on a 24 GB machine.

Both halves are pinned here: that the switch unloads, and that all three branches go through
the one helper rather than growing a fourth copy of the same three lines.

Offline: nothing is loaded or unloaded for real — `models._unload_model` is a spy.
