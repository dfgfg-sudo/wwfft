"""Enforces the one import rule the modularization depends on.

`config` and `state` hold values that are **rebound at runtime** — by the /parameters menu,
by `/lang`, by `--private`, by `--safe`, by the architect/editor swap, and by the tests
themselves. In Python, `from .config import STREAM_FINAL` copies the value into the importing
module at import time; later rebinding of `config.STREAM_FINAL` is then invisible to it.

The failure is silent and total: the code reads a stale constant forever, no exception is
raised, and behavioural tests that set the value the same wrong way still pass. So the rule is
mechanical and checked mechanically:

    from . import config          #  OK — binds the module, sees every later change
    import agentic.config         #  OK
    config.STREAM_FINAL           #  OK — resolved at each access
    from .config import STREAM_FINAL   # BANNED — frozen copy

Anything genuinely immutable and hot (regex patterns, lookup tables) can be imported by name
from any *other* module; this rule covers only `config` and `state`.

The test passes trivially until the `agentic/` package exists, so it can land before the split.
