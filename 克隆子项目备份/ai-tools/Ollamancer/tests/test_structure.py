"""Golden-master / structural invariants — the modularization safety net.

The other tests verify *behaviour*. This one freezes the agent's *shape*: the tool registry,
the slash-command set, the bilingual string tables, and the /parameters schema. Its whole
purpose is to fail loudly when a refactor silently loses or renames something while every
behavioural test still passes.

Two failure modes it is specifically designed to catch while agent.py is being split into
the `agentic/` package:

1. A function that quietly disappears during a move (registry counts drop).
2. A tunable that stops being *live* — /parameters reads and writes its values through the
   defining module's namespace, so a setting can still display, still persist to JSON, and
   still be silently disconnected from the code that reads it. `test_params_are_live` does a
   real round-trip (write -> read back through the schema) to prove the wiring survives.

Runs offline: importing agent has no side effects that need Ollama or the network.
