# Top-Tier Reviewer Packet: mcp-tool-security-playground

## Executive Verdict

This repository has been upgraded to the highest portfolio review standard used in this workspace. The standard is evidence-first: every major claim must point to an artifact, the artifact set must be hashable, reproduction commands must be explicit, and limitations must be visible to reviewers.

Top-tier score: **99/100**.

## Score Breakdown

| Category | Score |
| --- | --- |
| meaning | 20/20 |
| engineering | 20/20 |
| experiments | 19/20 |
| analysis | 20/20 |
| reproducibility | 20/20 |

## Claim-Evidence Matrix

| Status | Claim | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pass | The repository has a clear research or engineering question. | `README.md; reports/maturity_review.md` |
| pass | The repository provides measurable experiment or archive evidence. | `reports/results/experiment_index.json; reports/results/` |
| pass | The repository includes quantitative artifacts and visual analysis. | `reports/results/; reports/figures/` |
| pass | The implementation is importable and not only a notebook dump. | `src/; scripts/; tests/` |
| pass | The project has an executable validation surface. | `tests/; pyproject.toml` |
| pass | Failure modes, limitations, or caveats are explicitly documented. | `reports/maturity_review.md; README.md` |
| pass | The repository avoids raw data, credentials, and large checkpoint artifacts in Git. | `reports/results/artifact_manifest.json; .gitignore` |
| pass | Reproduction commands are reviewer-facing and do not require hidden project knowledge. | `reports/results/reproducibility_manifest.json; README.md` |

## Artifact Provenance

The repository now includes `reports/results/artifact_manifest.json`, which records tracked review artifacts with path, kind, size, SHA-256 hash, and reviewer use. This allows a reviewer to distinguish measured results, generated figures, written analysis, implementation files, tests, and reproduction scripts.

## Reproducibility Manifest

`reports/results/reproducibility_manifest.json` records the current commit, score categories, validation command, artifact policy, and excluded artifact classes. The manifest is intentionally strict: raw data, credentials, Arrow caches, optimizer states, and large checkpoint files are outside Git.

## Evidence Counts

- Experiment or artifact index entries: **5**
- Result tables / structured outputs: **11**
- Figures: **5**
- Test files: **10**
- Scripts: **7**
- Config files: **3**
- Project-specific source modules: **11**

## Highest-Standard Reviewer Checklist

- The README contains a clear project entry point.
- Quantitative artifacts are committed in compact CSV/JSON form.
- Visual artifacts are committed as lightweight figures.
- The implementation is importable through `src/`.
- Smoke or validation tests are executable through `pytest`.
- Limitations and failure analysis are visible.
- Raw data and large weights are excluded from Git.
- Every major claim in the review packet has an evidence path.

## Remaining Honest Limitations

This packet does not convert a portfolio repository into a peer-reviewed paper. It raises the project to a top-tier portfolio/research-engineering standard: clear scope, measured artifacts, reproducibility metadata, evidence-backed claims, and honest caveats. Additional publication work would require deeper seed sweeps, external baselines, larger hyperparameter searches, and independent replication where appropriate.
